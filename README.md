# Text Hierarchy Classification Project

This repository is a personal project aimed at exploring and implementing various text classification techniques for hierarchical structures. The goal is to learn and experiment with different methods to classify text data into multi-level hierarchies, improving understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning concepts.

## Features
- Implementation of specific structures for hierarchical classification algorithms.
- Dataset preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)
- NLTK/Spacy for text processing
- Polars/Numpy for data manipulation
