"My 3 1/2 year old daughter received this as a Christmas present and was so excited to play with it. We figured out that to get it to work with all the sounds and drums you had to turn on the power button on the guitar as well as on the microphone stand. We loved that this guitar had real strings. However, my daughter didn't quite get the idea that the plastic screws to adjust the strings actually affected the sound the strings make, so she continually turned them, and I had to keep adjusting them. In doing so one of the plastic screws snapped in half, and now the string hangs loosely and can not be tightened. We also have a problem with keeping the microphone stand adjusted to the height we desire. It has a knob to tighten it that doesn't actually seem to do anything.

I went over the short fur on their backs and got downy-type hair. I went over the long hair, always in the direction in which the hair was growing (comes from reading the directions)... and got lots more hair. Their backs were smooth, smooth, smooth to touch.

"Here's a mascara that looks like rich milk-chocolate in the clear tube, and provides a deep, dark, espresso-colored finish to the lashes. The color is very flattering, much less harsh than pure black.Just as nice is the fact that the product leaves lashes soft, without the spikey, stiff feel you get from some mascaras. In addition to length, this mascara also added a nice fullness.Tube design is also good. There's a ""flat"" shape to it that allows you to get a secure grip so you can easily use the little mirror that runs down the side.After a full day of wear, I experienced NO flaking, clumping, or smudging. NO racoon-eyes look. The product came off easily with my usual makeup remover.So, the product produces length, fullness, thickness, and nice color, without smudges, clumps, or flakes.

That is if I'm feeling generous. I don't know how many more Dora dolls I can take. All in all it's a good doll and if mine were broke I would just take it back and get a new one.

I really want to give this litter box 5 stars but I am on my third PREMIUM litter and it still doesn't work correctly. I finally decided to use what I considered a cheaper brand but read on the reviews that several people have used successfully - Arm & Hammer brand. Nothing has worked. I took the conveyor lid off and placed a pen in the hole so it would continue to work without the lid. I then watched as the waste sat at the bottom of the conveyor and just kept rolling until it would break up into tiny bits. So I decided to give it a little help and placed the waste on the conveyor. The first one just rolled back down breaking apart. The second one I put on actually went the rest of the way and dumped in.It isn't noisy and I haven't had any problems with it mechanically.If I could find a way to get the litter up the conveyor it would work great. Nothing has gone up and into the waste container by itself. The one piece I had to help. I end up having to clean it out by hand.I read all the instructions and I have used premium cat litter.

It even dries my hands.Let's move on, if you want to help your skin with pimples on your face, why buy an Oil Based Face Washer? NO, you have to buy an Oil-FREE product which is exactly what this product is.As of late, my face was breaking out BAD. I was using my typical acne cream [ZapZyt 10%!! Benzyl Peroxide] and Foam [AcneFree Severe Package] and 1 or 2 pimples would swell down or even disappear but 5 little ones or another big one would appear and people started commenting on my skin. Then I remembered that I wasn't using a Face Wash and I was using this product before. So I tried it again and in 3 days time!! My new pimples swell down, my old pimple scars are fading, and now no new pimples form. And this is me washing my face only once [it's recommended to wash your face twice so I may have gotten even faster results]. I LOVE this product. It may dry my face and hands but it's totally worth it if I'm getting acne free skin.",beauty,bath body,cleansers

The hardware specifications listed give the minimum system requirements, which computer exceeds, but it doesn't say that you have to have a desktop computer which is a pretty important thing to specify. Even if I purchase a separate keyboard to go with it it can't be used with a standard computer desk with a keyboard drawer. It can only be used on a flat table significantly larger than the average computer work station.

"This stroller looks great however is a waste of money and we no longer use it. I too am of average height (5'6"") the handle is too short therefore my feet hit the wheels while walking (even worse for my 6'1"" husband). The wheels are not sturdy and the stroller does not handle well on sidewalks. The sun visor is small and we end up having to place a blanket over the front end of the stroller which obstructs the view for the child.

"The Geotrax set is a great toy!!! We just bought the firestation and remote control firetruck for our son at Christmas. He is only 15 months old, but he loves this system!! Since Christmas, we have accumulated a large amount for his Geotrax system. We bought the Mountain Blast for him this month. This is a great addition!! Even though he is very young, he loves to push the dynamite to make the ""blast"" and he can understand how to work the remotes. He also loves to run the windmill. The Geotrax system seems to be very sturdy and durable for the younger children. It can get to be an expensive hobby. There are many more additions that we plan on getting him. The only draw back to that is finding room to store it all when it isn't being played with. Unfortunately, we do not have room to build it and leave it up all of the time, so we build him a small track to keep in his room all of the time and then we build the big layouts for him on the weekends. I love the fact that these additions do not have a bunch of little pieces that come apart, but it does present a problem as far as storage. There are a few things that they could do differently to make this set even better. The trains need to have 2 different speeds and go in reverse. That would make it alot more fun to play with. You will definetly need to invest in rechargeable batteries!!!!! You will go broke trying to replace regular batteries, they die out pretty fast. The rechargeables are more expensive to start, but they definetly pay off in the end. I would recommend this set to anyone with little kids - girls or boys. I have 10 year old twin girls that love to ""help"" their little brother play with his Geotrax. I think they have more fun with it than he does.

"Our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the Imaginext dinosaur sets, so we thought we'd really surprise him on Christmas this year with the Imaginext dragon set.While I'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's been playing with it for hours) I have a feeling we're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers.Pros:- Interesting color scheme- Good detail on most pieces- Re-configurable- The dragon figure is really neat- The trap door, rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate- Got it on sale at the local Toys R' Us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site.Cons- The directions are picture-only, and much too small to see fine detail.- The pieces are not packaged together logically, so that the elements of the set are all in one bag. You have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way, per the above comment about the directions.- The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly.I think that next year, we'll just stick to Legos.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets

"I was originally looking for a dry shampoo to use on my red hair. Washing my hair in the shower makes my color run really bad, and so a dry shampoo was my main option for longer lasting color. I tried the Suave and TreSemme dry shampoos first, and was greatly disappointed. The Suave worked GREAT, but after two uses the bottle was GONE. The TreSemme dry shampoo proved to be a waste of money also. It smelled good, but it left my hair feeling gritty at best, and still oily and dirty at worst. Then I tried using baby powder. That was working pretty well. It worked really good on second day hair and fairly well on third day hair. However, it was messy to deal with; too much made me look like I had dandruff and made my hair a weird color. It also built up in my hair so by the time I washed in the shower, my hair needed a thorough scrubbing (not so great for keeping my color).When I heard about this stuff, I was a little skeptical, but the price for the amount you get, plus all the good reviews convinced me to purchase it. The first time I used it, I was amazed! I tried it on hair that had not been washed or dry shampooed or anything in four days (gross, I know.) After my hair dried, it looked like freshly washed hair! I was shocked. Also, my hair typically bleeds anytime it gets wet, but there was no color leakage using this! It works wonders on dirty hair. It doesn't leave behind any weird textures or products. It just.. Cleans. I do wish this left my hair with some kind of scent like most dry shampoos, but overall it is a great product.

"I am a hairdresser so I really rely on trimmers. I'd bought them from a nearby beauty supplier, as they were the only trimmers they had been selling at the time. I can easily say I will never buy Andis again.firstly, at retail it was about $80 which I didn't think was too bad, but then I realized ""oh hey, this isn't cutting at all"" it ripped at the hair splitting the ends and turning it to dust, and pulled a lot. This was after I had just got them. So I returned them to the 'repairs center' from the Andis company, it cost me 16 dollars to mail it, they mailed me a brand new one, it worked fantastically and I was thrilled! Until yesterday, that is. (I've only had them back for about 2 months, maybe less) when they decided that they did not want to turn on anymore. when they are plugged in, it looks like they are charging, but they don't turn on. It's ridiculous, and an extreme inconvenience.Turns out 3 other girls at my work have also had issues with Andis products. One had the same thing as me, the other said her charger stopped working (she also had bought andis clippers and those had worked well for only 3 months.), another one said the life on hers has been iffy.so basically, I ended up spending 100 bucks for 2 months. because I won't count that first month since I couldn't use them anyways.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

The song is a cute rendition of the familiar tune and Elmo is Elmo (so kids will love him).The toy itself, while being pretty cool at first, quickly makes you wonder what the engineers were thinking. It's fairly unstable (top heavy), enough so that the ""Help Elmo, he fell down"" is triggered on nearly every play.It's a one-trick pony too. And although the outer coat is soft, the interior isn't, so your child won't be squeezing it. My kid likes it, but doesn't really play with this one much. It's sort of sad, he was given it as a very thoughtful (and pricey) gift; so it's hard to be objective about the toy vs. the gesture.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures
I seen an earlier review about losing the blocks with the other blocks in the house. I personally have always helped put the blocks back into the box they came in. (Which is a challange in itself. And can be great fun also for the child to figure out just how to get them back in the way they came. But I have always gave assistance in doing this. The box is great to keep the cards and blocks together and it's then easy reconizable when looking on the shelves for what you want to grab.)This is a HUGE hit with every small child whom comes to our home. My son has now sort of outgrew them. There isn't such a challange any longer. But I love the idea of the numbered cards. And #1 being the easiest level and then they get more challanging. And it's something I won't be parting with. But pulling out when I have smaller children come visit. It's just to great to get rid of...We're moving up to Time Blocks which is a simular idea of block shapes...With a timer for more of a challange.

It's impossible to break off the plastic nubs cleanly - they're sharp! I had to cut them off with a box cutter. The item is only 1 shade of pink and not 2 like the photos show.

"Like many people out there, i've used an electric pump and was sceptical about a manual one. Let me just say that this pump is great. The only thing i realized fairly quickly is that although it advertizes that it can express milk as fast as an electric pump, which in my experience it can, it's still only doing one side at a time. So when i realized how good it was, i went out and got another one! Now while pumping with my right and left hands, i was indeed filling the bottles as quickly as i did with the pump-in-style.I work in many different places, and dragging around a big motor and tubes and plugs that had to be connected and plugged was very annoying. Not to mention heavy, in addition to my work items that i have to lug to and from my car too. I also did not always have access to an outlet, or space to spread out. The last thing you want to do is put your pump on the floor of a germ-infested bathroom stall. I was also never a fan of having people walking into a restroom hearing the whine of an electric pump and knowing what i'm doing and where. But the Avent is lightweight and plug free. It's quiet. It goes straight onto the avent bottles, or i often pumped into the Avent storage cups so it could go right into the fridge or freezer when i got home. And i personally found the hand levers very comfortable. A friend of mine told me she even keeps one Avent pump in her car in case of emergencies, like if she is stuck away from home and it's expressing time. If you are looking for a manual pump, this is definitely the way to go. And if you are open to electric or manual, this is definitely one you should be looking into!",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding
"I anxiously began using this the day it arrived. My cats love it and I was able to remove an amazing amount of hair on the very first use. I could have combed further but my nose was itching and I was wondering whether my ""babies"" would have been bald!Be careful, however, as it is possible to remove too much hair - especially around their backs. Once the hair becomes accustomed to the grooming I find it becomes stronger.I used to use one of those round shredder types of tools but they required much more effort and time.

"As a long time Catan player, I was looking for something to spice up gameplay without dropping $40 on another expansion. The Event Cards were a great option.The cards are drawn from their deck in place of rolling a dice. Regular Catan gameplay is followed otherwise. Several cards have basic gameplay instructions (harvest crops, activate robber, etc.) while adding in new gameplay elements like Earthquakes, Good Neighbors, and Epidemics, among others. The Earthquake for example might damage an existing road, and no new roads can be created until the road is repaired. Another card might call for the player with the largest current army to give production cards to all other players. Or the player with the most ports might get their choice of a free production card.I wouldn't say gameplay is radically different by using the Event Cards, but the little tweaks are fun. When used with the 'Cities & Knights' expansion, several additional changes are listed on the cards. I have not tried this with the C&E; expansion, but it looks to effect gameplay even more than in a traditional game.My only knock is that the 'roll of the dice' are much more predictable. There are x amount 9's, 12's, etc. So the randomness of the dice is completely absent. If you're sitting on a 3 and an 11, you're pretty well stuck for the duration of the game. On the upside, they'll definitely come up at least once, but not over and over as the dice might provide. It leads to a somewhat stagnant feeling if you have weak placement.Overall, it's a nice little addition to change up the game for familiar players, and at an affordable price, but is lacking the excitement the regular dice provide.",toys games,games,board games

"This is a cute toy with many small accessories not mentioned in the product description. Each doll has a blanket, toothbrush and pillow as well as a mask that coordinates with her pajamas. There are little DVDs and popcorn, cookies, soda, cups (only three cups for five dolls, though).If you have a three year old like I do, the cute accessories will get lost within an hour. These dolls do not have brushes and their hair gets very frizzy quickly. The shoes are mule style and fall right off. It might not be easy to tell the racial variety of the dolls from the picture, but all but one are white, and the other is of ambiguous race. Living in an ethnically diverse community, I found this disappointing.All in all, it is a very cute set with many accessories and it is a very good buy. Be forewarned that is is very heavily packaged and you will spend at least half an hour freeing the dolls and accessories from the box.

"This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's, then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex, and since its natural, I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review, I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week, and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes, as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense, some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews, I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic ""lady fix"".",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"I don't (to my knowledge) have psoriasis. What I do have is fairly bad recurrent dandruff, flaking, and scalp itching. I had used T-Gel regularly with good results, but I wanted to try something stronger. I found MG217 shampoo on the internet and went to my local Walgreen's to buy it.It works great. It's the only thing I have used that seems to knock out the dandruff and itching immediately upon the first use. In addition, when shampooing my hair, I spread some of the shampoo over my face where I get red, flaky, itchy skin which I think is related to the dandruff. It eliminates that problem, too... leaving my facial skin much better.Yes, it does smell, but I am used to that and actually kind of like it (call me weird). Also, it IS pretty strong, so I wouldn't recommend using it every day (and neither do they).Alternate using it with a mild baby shampoo, and use a good conditioner and you should have good results.This has also helped with my hair-loss. Not that it makes your hair grow back, but hair fall that seems to be associated with sebum build-up and associated scalp condition is less when using MG217.I recommend it.",beauty,hair care,shampoos

Also, there's really no clean up as you simply throw the filter out when you're done using. These are also great if you are sharing your teas or having people try your teas out. Simply put the tea in the filter and voila. The argument can be made that a diffuser is more cost efficient as you don't need to buy more diffusers as is the case with these filters. However, again, there's no cleaning, I'm not tied to a particular cup/diffuser, and I can share. If the concern is that the filter does not allow the leaf to fully expand, simply buy a larger filter size 2,3,etc. The flavor of the teas really come through.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown

"We received this carrier as a gift off our baby registry. I looked at reviews of other models (including the regular, non-active Baby Bjorn) and inspected those available at Babies R Us, so we sort of knew what to expect. This baby carrier is awesome!!! I would definitely give it as a gift. My daughter is now about 23 lbs, and I recently carried her around in the Baby Bjorn through a museum exhibition (sum total with entry, exit, etc. almost 2 hours), and I felt great, and she really enjoyed herself. I was a little nervous since we are nearing the weight limit (26 lbs), but it really worked out quite well, and it was easy to move through the exhibit. Note I am not particularly physcially fit, strong, or tall, and I find this carrier quite comfortable. We have used this for longs walks; in urban areas and stores where strollers are difficult/impossible to manuver; and we plan to use it on an upcoming flight to board the plane. My husband also seems to really like it -- he volunteers to wear it when we go places.It took me a little bit to figure out how to use the carrier. I read the directions, but you almost need to see it on someone first to see how everything connects (I had only seen the empty store models...). One you ""get it"", you're good to go and you won't have future issues, but just be aware before you use it the first time that you may need to lay it all out to get it figured out and fastened (practice *without* your baby); don't get your tiny baby all ready and expect to figure it out instantly when you pull it out of the box (although if you can, great!). Also, once you start to carry your baby, the directions advise you to ""practice"" with your baby to help build up his/her ride tolerance. I did this by carrying ours around the house for short spurts of time. It might help to have someone with you (to help hold the baby while you get the carrier on) the first couple of times you use it, although I did not.Although our daughter now walks, this carrier is **very** convenient for certain settings, and I will be sorry when we outgrow it!Note",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers
"Like others mentioned, I did not receive the seat pictured (little roads with red handles) but I ordered two so I thought at least one would be the red one. No luck. The big bummer is that the seat is so cheap that it comes apart really easy.

The good thing is that my son won't even think about using them so I can consign or return them. He likes the original, plain old white Mommy's Helper seat I got as a hand-me-down.

The Mommy's helper seat is especially nice for me since it has a handle in the back (far from dribble) and is ALL ONE UNIT...no concern that it's gonna fall apart every time I move it. Potty training is tough enough without extra crap like this. I just though he would get excited to see McQueen...but instead he thinks is a toy.

"I agree with the previous reviews. However, I wanted to add that the diaper champ has a two blue knobs on the side that are meant to be moved to remove the upper part. This way you can clean it in case it gets dirty but it's so hard to put back together that I wouldn't remove it. If it gets dirty just clean around it. I took it apart and had to play around with it for days to get it attached again. Also putting odor protectant bags helps with the smell too.",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

"This is a durable, attractive, stroller that functions as intended. It folds up like any umbrella stroller, but we keep it open so its ready for use. I couldn't tell you how well it functions if it is opened and closed repeatedly.The wheels are not multi-directional and are made of rigid plastic. To keep the wheels in good condition, I would only use this stroller on flat surfaces indoors.I was surprised at how small the stroller actually is.

"Ok, so my daughter has been through 3 car seats. The 1st was one of those with a detachable base, which I will always recomend to new parents. But she was 18lbs at 5 months and we knew we needed a new one. We got the Britax Roundabout and it was fabulous for all the reasons I love Britax. But she is skinny and tall for her age and was too tall for the Roundabout (it goes up to 40 inches and she was that tall at 3 1/2).So on to the 3rd ... the Wizard. It has a very small base that fits in the bucket seat in the back of a Firebird Trans Am. It is rated to go on aircraft, so instead of checking it, you could always hook it up and have your child ride in it - it makes air travel more familiar (check with your airline to make sure they put the proper stickers at check in so the stewards let you use it).I drive a Chevy Equinox and we had to remove the head rest from the one side to install it properly (you stick an awl in the little hole next to the button and then pop it out - very easy). It has a 60/40 split and if you put the seat in the middle, you can't put down either side. We put her on the 60 side so she would have more room and not get squished by any long objects we were carrying.I like that this seat goes up to 65 lbs ([...] site is correct), even though I am sure she will be too tall (49 inches) for this one before she is too heavy. If you do have a heavier toddler, a car seat is still your safest option. Even if they qualify for a booster at 36 lbs, I still think they should be in a car seat as long as possible.When it is time to move to a booster, I am sure we will go with the Britax brand, it goes up to 100 lbs and 60 inches (5 feet tall)! I would recomend they stay in a booster for as long as possible also, even short statured adults have problems in accidents (the safety system is designed for a 5' 10"" male).",baby products,car seats accessories,accessories

"I love this portable potty seat!!!My arms tired of holding my 2 year old son so he won't fall into public toilets, and after an incident where one automatically flushed under him, I decided to get a portable, foldable potty seat for use while we are out and about.This is the first one I have tried (I studied them carefully, pros and cons)and I LOVE it for what it is. It folds up small, it supports my son well without fear of falling in, it does not pinch him at all (hinges are covered), it fits at the FRONT of the toilet seat, it's a great thing to have on hand. My son likes it because it's an ""exciting"" new thing to him. It has greatly reduced his fear of the auto-flush, and we have had no problems with it.",baby products,potty training,potties seats

"I don't know why other reviewers say this toy doesn't work, because it does! I bought 2 of them for Christmas, and both of them worked just fine. You can test it while still in the packaging (which I did), so it obviously had some sort of battery in it already, and we were playing with it right out of the package. And as long as you keep your mouth close to the microphone area when talking, and hold the ""trigger"" the entire time, the changed voice is by far louder than your normal voice. You can change the settings to lots of different combinations to get different voices. My six year old nephew had a blast with this, but the funny thing is, the adults enjoyed it just as much as the kids! It has one deep, Darth Vader-type voice, so of course all the adults wanted to say ""Luke, I am your father!"" into it, LOL. The six year old was walking around telling everyone to ""Take me to your leader."" in a robotic voice. It will also do high-pitched voices, and many other combos.

It is easy for her to hold onto, it floats so she can easily find it and it writes under water too, which she really loves. My main complaint with this is that it does not easily wash off a tub surround. In the actual tub, it comes right off with a wet hand, but even after wiping it off the walls of the tub surround right after a bath time art session, it still doesn't completely come off, there are still light shadows of what once was on there.

"I have been a Braun user for over 10 years using all of their various electric shavers. I have found the Panasonic ES8152NC to be the best yet and less expensive. I have only used it dry - the results have been very good. Not as close as a safety razor, but very good. The combination of blades takes care of the short and long hairs. I find it does a very good job on the neck region, always a problem spot. You do need (like any electric) to go over the face areas several times to get the closest shave. It is comfortable to hold and very quiet for an electric. The side trimmer is not the greatest but works. I get around six shaves befor recharging is needed.Cleaning it is simple as you can run the whole head in a stream of water with a little liquid soap - saves having to buy special solutions like in the Braun shaver cleaner. Really ideal.I highly recommend this shaver.As a side note, the price at Amazon was the lowest and I ordered it on a Sunday night and got it three days later using their free shipping!

It takes them a few days to get used to having no tray, we had a lot of food on the floor the first couple days. But now they get it, and its so easy to clean under and wipes up easily. Its very sturdy. My second hand one was missing the pads, but I just took some GooGone to the glue and then stuck on little felt pads, fixed that problem right up. I can't say how well it works outside my house because I haven't tried it, but I can see it being helpful if it clamps on the table.

"We have had this litter box for about 6 months now and it works great. We were a bit unsure if the cats would take to the new design, but we followed the directions of having it side-by-side with our old unit for a while and they couldn't resist. The design is great for keeping the litter in the litter box. Our cats like to scratch and scratch and they often threw litter all over the floor near the old covered box. This unit does not have this issue. There will be some litter on the top of the unit, but that is by design and is not an issue.We don't use the liners for this, but just clean it out and periodically dump the litter for a new batch. When we do that, we'll wash it out, which is not a big deal. The unit is basically like a large storage bin with a smooth hole cut out of the top. Very clever design, which works well. It also keeps our dogs out of the litter box. Now if we can just find a way to keep them out of the cat food!If you are considering this unit, don't hesitate. It works well. Sturdy and solid plastic.

"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

"We really like this crate--our retriever/shepherd is happy that she can see us and still have her private time. Even though it folds down and has a carrier, when we're in the middle of getting everyone out of the house and into the car, it just seems like too many steps on top of all the other things we're moving. Plus, who wants to set it back up when you're inside the back of the car, or on the ground--especially if it's raining or snowing? So, if you buy the 43 X 28 crate, just know that it will BARELY fit through your doorways and it will probably take two people to lug it down steps or put it into the car.

I love the product and have bought at other places. The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places. When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already. OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open. 4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.,grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks

"Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a cute toy that gives children the chance to imitate adults and older siblings in the act of cleaning. Children like to do the things they observe others doing and with this Playskool vacuum, kids can experience the sounds and actions of a vacuum cleaner, giving them the feeling that they are right there, next to mom and dad, keeping the home clean and livable.This vacuum is fun for toddlers for several reasons. First, it offers the open view of the inside, where kids can watch the swirling ""lint"" as they push the vacuum across the floor. This makes the vacuum look and seem like the actual vacuum that mom and dad use every week. Second, kids like the cute sayings and will often repeat them as they play. Dusty makes comments such as Who Spilled the Beans, Nobody Cleans Better than We Do, and more. Dusty talks to the child and talks back and forth with his sidekick- the attached brush. Kids will like the sayings and many will look forward to listening to Dusty talk about the cleaning task and how well they are doing.Many children's toys that include sounds are quite noisy, but this is one area where the Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is different. There are some sounds with this toy, but they are muffled and shouldn't bother anyone. Some toys offer loud noises and, worse, some do not have a switch to reduce the noise level. This vacuum doesn't have a switch to reduce the sound, but there is an on/off switch to stop the sound completely. The cool thing about turning off the sound is that the swirling and eye moments will still continue, and this could be enough to satisfy many children.As for fun and entertainment, this toy ranks above average, but one thing I have noticed with my girls is that they never play with it for very long. They continue to use it on a regular basis, which shows that it does have a certain appeal. However, they will push it back and forth for only about a minute or so, then set it aside in favor of other toys. This result would lead one to conclude that their interest is low, but the fact remains that they still reach for the vacuum on a regular basis. Even though it holds their interest for a very brief period of time, they still like it for its short burst of stimulation.Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a fun toy for boys or girls in the preschool age group. It is very lightweight, makes little noise, and requires only a simple push across a floor to get it going. It isn't a huge hit with my youngsters, but they do like it consistently, even if only in small doses. It is a good toy that helps children feel like they are helping mom and dad while having a little fun in the process.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play

After using this deodorant for about a month now I am amazed at the longevity of Lavilin in stopping odor. One particular application lasted for over 5 days and could probably have lasted longer. I am a person who used regular deodorant and had to apply maybe two to three times per day. Another one of my concerns was not getting yet another synthetically chemical infested deodorant. I have terrible allergic reactions to the dyes and what not in normal products. This was really a lifesaver for me. The only real qualm I have with the product is the price per ounce. It comes in at over $20 per ounce (that is more than the price of silver) and you only get 0.44 ounces. Mine only lasted a month without any real strenuous physical activity. And even if it lasts 2 months it would still be double the price of a stick of regular deodorant. My real problem with the deodorant is you can't find it at regular stores. I'm not going to buy a month's worth of deodorant and pay $5 in shipping costs everytime I run out of the miniscule amount that is given.,health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements
"Lolita Lempicka is an unusual fragrance in that you won't find everyone else wearing it. That semi-exclusivity, along with its exotic name, lends it an air of elitism. All this at a price that's typically less than the Acqua di Gios and Polos of the world that seem to envelope every restaurant and bar around the globe.Lolita starts out a bit strong, with sharp notes of licorice and black pepper, but quickly dries down to heady blend of cotton-candy and sweet spice. It's absolutely intoxicating, if a bit sweet. But don't let that sweetness scare you - it's a refreshing change from whatever you've been wearing.After sampling Lolita and wearing it for a few days, I discovered that it has staying power usually found only in EDPs or especially cloying scents like Hypnose or heavily woodsy ones, like Polo Explorer.For me, Lolita Lempicka offers tremendous longevity; I spray two or three times in the morning (on pulse points, like the base of the neck and behind the ears) and find that it dries down and lasts well into the evening.You'll find yourself telling everyone what your wearing, as the longevity offers numerous opportunities for the curious to inquire as to your fragrance.

"I just purchased this from a discount beauty supply yesterday and used it this morning. I have somewhat dry, color-treated hair in a neutral red shade that was fading fast. This particular color gave me the coppery deep red I like, without the weird purple tint of some other red dyes I have tried. In addition, this is the shiniest my hair has been after coloring. The smell is pleasant. I will definitely use this again, but I will do a few things differently next time because I found the product to be extremely messy. Next time I think I will shampoo and towel dry like the instructions say, but I think I will actually put the product on my hair in the shower and sit out the 25 minutes there. This stuff is very drippy and even though I was careful, I wound up with droplets here there and everywhere. I put on a clear disposable cap that helped a little, but still - very messy and that's coming from an experienced ""bathroom chemist"" who has used a lot of hair coloring.I left the product on for 25 minutes as directed and I rinsed but did not let the water run completely clear. It's a little trick I do to ""set"" the color so it lasts longer. Once I had most of the product out and the water still had a little tint still showing, I put on my regular cheapo conditioner, rinsed it out and blew my hair dry. I was pleased that the color didn't ""grab"" on the ends of my hair and make them too dark like some other products have done. So - I got a nice even tone - very shiny, soft and a vibrant copper red tone. Why haven't I heard of this stuff before? 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mess.",beauty,hair care,hair color

"It doesn't really hold the floss taut enough to get in the hard to reach areas, and if your teeth are tight together, the lack of tension might prove to be a bit of a challenge to get the floss in between the teeth. I've had the floss get stuck between my teeth and I had to unwind the entire thing from the Flossaid to pull the floss out. No amount of tightening it made it taut enough. (I don't have a problem with things like the disposable flossers or the Reach Flossers.) That's just the way it is with these type of flossing tools. I've had similar ones in the past and they're all like that. The plastic does bend/flex a bit and if it was a sturdier, harder plastic, it may provide more floss tension, but then again, it could cause the Flossaid to snap. It's a give n take so it's fine the way it is. Just gotta learn to work with it. With a bit of patience this gets the job done and it's more economical than buying disposable flossers.The Flossaid is a bit on the wide side so if you have a small mouth, or if you plan on getting it for children, it might not work well.I still think that Reach Flossers and disposable flossers are easier to use, but having to buy refills for the Reach Flossers for the entire family gets really expensive so the Flossaids will do fine.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"We purchased this unit and it was okay. We do like having video in addition to audio. Main problems:(1) The neighbor has one as well, so we would pick up her crib occasionally, and she picks up ours.(2) Noise. We often have a substantial amount of static bursts over time which means it is difficult to keep the volume on at night. Even during the day it is annoying.My recommendation is to purchase the Summer digital video monitor instead of this one. It is more expensive, but the following features/differences were absolutely worth it:(1) Secure. We have no overlap with the neighbor and given the nature of digital communications they won't be able to pick up our feed.(2) Clear channel. No static. Beautiful picture.(3) Motorized camera. I didn't think this would be useful, but really like it. With the handheld unit, you can remotely change where the video camera is pointing. Sometimes we sleep our infant in our car seat in her room (if she is congested for instance) and it is nice to be able to remotely point the camera at her or the crib without having to set it up properly in advance.

"I really did not want to purchase this toy since I thought it wouldn't work well and would be a waste of money but it was the main thing my 5 year old son asked for and I couldn't disappoint him. I have been pleasantly surprised with this toy. The actual assembly did not take very long (less than a 1/2 hour) except for the 75 stickers--that took over an hour. It does some very cool ""stunts"" like the car is shot up a ramp and down a track into a glider plane, which then takes off for a short flight with the car in it. It also performs pretty consistently. It is true that these little one shot stunts are all this toy does but they are pretty cool to watch. I do think the toy is a little pricey for what it does but at least I don't feel like I have a pile of junk to show for it like has happened with some other car track sets (including Hot Wheels ones)in the past.",toys games,vehicles remote control,vehicle playsets

It works best on hair that is stubbly/not lying against the skin... but, let's face it, all electric shavers have that problem. My boyfriend uses it on his face but I've actually taken to using it on my bikini area and it really does a fantastic, FAST job in both places.The cleaning system and replace foil notification was really a plus for us, as my boyfriend was the type who would rarely ever clean the hair out of his shaver (or if he did he managed to get it all over the bathroom), always forgot to charge it (and would shave as it made that sad struggling sound uncharged shavers make), and never knew when to replace the blades. Because the base both cleans and charges after each use you never have to get a sub par shave due to clogging or forgetting to charge it.

"My skin still problematic in my late 20's, I was desperate for a new makeup routine.

It's SO fine, DOESN'T settle into lines, and literally sets makeup ALL DAY. Maybe a minor touch-up after 6 hours, but that's it. It looks beautiful in photos and has true staying power. Yes, it's expensive. But you get so much powder for the money, I'm guessing it will last me 6 months.

"I did multiple hours worth of research before deciding on which razor to buy. Unfortunately I'm very fair skinned, and I have rarely been able to shave in the past with a razor (believe me I have tried every kind) and not get razor burn. I even went to the dermatologist and after trying different approaches, they informed me that I was just more or less out of luck. Then I stumbled across the 790.The pros to this product in my opinion:-Hardly any razor burn (rarely get and and it is usually a stubble or two)-Built well and doesn't feel cheap.-The Hygeine meter is a nice feature, plus the self cleaning is great.The cons:-The 790 seems to shave my cheeks perfectly and in no time. It really does feel like a blade went over it. However when it comes to my neck, it doesn't do as great of a job. I have tried different angles, stretching my skin, but sometimes it's like it can't quite get my neck as smoothe. It also leaves my skin red (but only for an 30 min-hour or so because of the pressure put against it from the razor trying to get all the hairs removed).-The clean and renew cartridges are fairly expensive, but as a word of advice, you don't have to clean this thing after every shave! I clean it once every 2 shaves, which for me equals out to 3 times a week.-Self cleaning can be kind of loud, so I recommend shutting the door or starting it while you are headed out of the house.Overall, if you haven't had any luck with a regular razor blade, then I would recommend this product.

"This stuff is amazing! For the past month I had developed a bad cough with phlegm and couldn't get rid of it no matter what i did. When I finally went to the doctor, he told me I had allergies and would have to use an inhaler, allergy pill, and a prescribed nasal spray. I couldn't believe it! I was like is my nose that stuffed up? What I realized was that I had very bad post nasal drip. It didn't matter that I slept on 5 pillows to elevate my head. Every morning I would without a doubt cough of phlegm. Panicked, I started researching post nasal drip and how to get rid of it and found out about neti pots and the simply saline mist. I bought the simply saline mist because it is closely related to the neti pot and i wanted to test it out to see if it actually works before I purchase the neti pot. Guess what? It works!!What I like about the simply saline mist is that you don't really have to prepare the mixture (like the neti pot). You just tilt your head and poof it will come out of your other nasal passage. I was disgusted/ intrigued with how much mucus I had in my nose! I could breathe and smell fine before but wow!!!! Just imagine if I did feel my nose stuffed. My doctor was absolutely right, it was my allergies (that I never knew I had) and my nose all along. No tonsillitis or bronchitis like I thought I had before. I will be sure to use simply saline in the morning and night from now on. I am determined to get off an inhaler and back to health.Oh and another tip of advice. At first I couldnt get the the mist to empty out from the other nasal passage. Sure, mucus would be coming out of that one nose, but what the hell why wasn't it coming out of the other nose like I saw in demonstrations online?

"I've been with my boyfriend a long time and recently he moved a few hours away, so we are currently in a long distance relationship. Like most men these days, he's been brainwashed by culture and the media that all women are supposed to be 100% smooth and naturlly hair free except for head eyebrows and eye lashes. And- like a lot of guys, he made me feel self conscious about my dark hair. we used to see eachother a lot and I was pretty much shaving everyday...you name it...and i probably shaved it. Since he went away i've been lazy and not shaving anymore, but since my hair is growing out i thought i'd take the opportunity to remove the hair with a new method that might make it come back slower. I discovered this product and when i read that it made hair NEVER COME BACK i naturally HAD to try it. I was so excited i tried it right away. I read some review that said it hurt, but i've tried waxing and plucking hairs and i'm pretty good at dealing with the pain so i thought what the hell i'm sure i can deal. It said it created a slight tingling sensation...aka BURNING PAIN. The directions said the average setting was 4 (it goes to 10) and that you should apply it on each hair for 15 seconds. I had it set on 1 and i tried it on a hair and couldn't even leave it in for 5 seconds it burned so bad. i can't even imagine the people who set it to 10! they must be either crazy or desensitized. i kept trying to give it a chance over and over but it was so painful. i tried to set it on 2 and started swearing. The package says to keep the tweezers on hand to pull out the dead hair when you're done so you don't have to look away and loose your spot. Let me tell you...you don't even have to worry about loosing your spot...the area is so red and the pore is bubbling with white puss looking stuff that..trust me you WON'T loose your spot. The only thing that this product made me realize is how ridiculous it is- the pain we go through to look good and the pressure us women (and men) are put under for having hair on our bodies that is completely natural and harming no one! i have read that the product does infact remove hair forever, this was my first time using it so i can't say that for sure yet. so, if you want to go through that and your hair is gone forever...more power to you and good luck...i hope you don't pass out from the pain. i read a review about a man who didnt believe his wife about the pain so he tried it...he was in the marines and said it hurt like hell. I was skeptical but now i believe him. If you want electrolysis i recomend you have a few stiff drinks and then go get it professionaly done.",baby products,diapering,disposable diapers

"This swaddle blanket is simply amazing. After my son was born, it was about a month of sleepless nights, and then my son finally began to sleep 4-5 hour stretches through the night on his own. That was until he hit 4 months, then he began constantly waking up every 30 minutes to an hour once again. My wife and I thought we had passed this stage, so needless to say, we were pretty stressed to be barely sleeping again. I found this on Amazon through a simple search, and regardless of the reviews, I decided this probably wouldn't work but why not give it a try. Boy was I wrong - it's like this blanket literally hits a sleep switch in my sons brain. He is literally sleeping for hours and hours at night now - to the point we generally have to wake him up in the morning to feed and change him.

"I used to take the original Xenadrine before the FDA pulled ephedrine from the markets and I could testify that it worked like a charm. I had lost maaaad weight with it. Then I tried the EFX with some disappointment. I almost switched to Ripped Fuel's newest product when I noticed Xenadrine's Super Hard Core on the shelf right next to it.Since I tend to be a loyalist with my products, and I prefer as FEW pills a day as possible, I gave it a shot. My body's fairly robust when it comes to being affected by supplements, but I started with a single pill twice a day and it was great. Energy and appetite suppression. I've stepped up to three pills (2 early, 1 later) a day and can say my faith is renewed in Xenadrine. I haven't been this happy with them since the original formula was out. In fact, with my tendency toward acid reflux, Xenadrine Super Hard Core has IN NO WAY caused my stomach to be upset like the original formula used to do.

"My favorite diaper system was discontinued, so I used just a trash can for a while and finally I couldn't stand the baby's room smelling so bad that I broke down and bought the diaper genie II (after reading all the reviews). I was so excited. I set it up in two seconds and we were ready to go. After 4 diapers and only one day of use, every time I opened the lid to push another diaper into the pail, a horrid smell came out of the pail. I emptied the pail the next day and even when it was empty and I put my first diaper in it, there was the smell again. I even put baking soda into the bag, and nothing helps. I nearly gag every time I open the pail. I would return it but I stupidly threw the box out already. What a waste of money! I'm sure it would work fine for newborns who drink breastmilk, since their diapers don't really smell much anyway, but my DD is a toddler. I am totally disappointed.

"""What better way to suggest friendliness-and to create it- than with a cup of tea?""-- J. Grayson LuttrellThis is bit of a departure from my usual reviews but I'm certainly fond of tea, and there's nothing like the right cup of tea to accompany an evening read, good music, or a compelling movie. I won't claim any sophisticated knowledge of tea and tea drinking -just that I know what I like, much as I do anything else! ^_^Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of many exotic teas produced by Harney & Sons. It comes in silken sachets (elegant pyramid shaped bags that show off the blend within and allow the tea to breathe) and I'm not surprised it is one of the company's most popular blends. Those sachets are definitely eye-catching. Even the occasional tea-drinker will notice an aesthetic difference in the presentation. Despite the posh packaging, this is a tea that kicks its shoes off and pulls on the fuzzy slippers and settles into a comfy chair by the fire.Hot Cinnamon Sunset is black tea, several cinnamons, orange and cloves. A medium bodied tea that can be served with sugar or honey and milk if desired. You don't need a great deal of sugar with this one, even if you have a sweet tooth like mine. The cinnamon sweetness is pretty powerful. This is the kind of tea that is perfect for casual company-especially during the holidays. For friends and family who might normally prefer something like Lipton teas, this will be a delightful change, but won't be too subtle or intimidating either. For those who prefer Oolongs, and teas that just hint at aroma and flavor, this won't, pardon the expression, be your cup of tea. This is also the type of tea best served -dare I say it-in a big mug. Cinnamon sunset is just that kind of comfort tea. Great for a rainy day snuggled up under the blankets.This tea is the perfect accompaniment for me when I'm rereading a book I love. An old favorite from my childhood, such as CHARLOTTE'S WEB by E.B. White or one of my Terry Pratchett novels, such as A HAT FULL OF SKY. Music-wise, I'd recommend the sweet and mellow sounds of Mary Youngblood on the Native American flute. Or, if you're into the holiday season, then a robust selection of carols or holiday favorites.Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea

"Really, curling irons are not newfangled inventions - they've been around for centuries. So to put one on the market with such a wretched design is truly irresponsible. Both the on-off switch and the temperature setting are right where you grab the thing to use it, which means that by using it you constantly bump the temperature off setting or turn it off inadvertently. The temperature wheel is so loose - and not a click wheel - that it is impossible to set a temperature and insure that it stays there, which can lead to serious burns on the skin or hair.

"China Glaze is by far my favorite brand when it comes to nail polish and this color was no exception. Now I was a little skeptical when I first came across this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase. Some people mentioned a problem with the color itself, not being true to the bottle color and having to use a million coats. Well first I must say that person was a little dramatic and then I would agree that at first glance it seems that way. When I first got it and painted it on my bare nails I found myself to be disappointed but after playing around a little I found that if you put a single coat of white nail polish on BEFORE using this nail polish the color will be true to the bottle. You'll still need to use about three coats of this but trust me it's worth it. This nail polish is super fast drying which is great if you're in a hurry but I will mention that it has a matte like finish, if you're not into that don't let that stop you from buying this!

"I am currently six months pregnant and having trouble getting comfortable at night. After reading the rave reviews, I purchased this pillow thinking it would be so great for me. I was disappointed when I tried it. Here's why:1. Getting the cover on and off to wash is a real pain.2. The curved part digs into my shoulder and really hurts. I've tried to stretch the cover and shove another pillow there to help but the seam just really cuts into me.3. It is absolutely HUGE and heavy. Since I cannot really use it as intended because of the shoulder problem, I flipped it upside down so I can use it as a regular body pillow. This is OK but the end of the pillow hangs off the bed and is heavy when I try to flip over with it. I toss and turn a lot so this creates a problem.4. This pillow makes me so hot I wake up drenched in sweat.I would recommend something smaller and more manageable. I don't feel that this has helped me sleep better at all. I will keep trying different positions with it to see if I can make it work since I did pay a lot for it. I can't really return it since we've already used it and washed the cover. :-(",baby products,pregnancy maternity,maternity pillows

"This is extremely well designed to be a very hygienic solution. The brush is ergonomically designed to get that commode clean without scratching or scraping the ceramic. The 'putty' color is discreet and with a small footprint, it can stand adjacent to the seat for quick and easy cleaning. Get this gross job done in about a minute or less. Great device.The canister is very well designed & allows for great air flow. The brush can then air dry while keeping your bathroom untouched & clean.Unit made of heavy duty plastic. Brush has any bristles, sturdy, 360 degree capacity. After much use, bristles do not fall out, et crushed, rusty or misshapen.For best results, I'll put a cleanser in the toilet (eg. Lysol. Clorox greenworks), clean the toilet, shake most moisture out of brush, place the damp brush over garbage pail to air dry, then put it back in its canister. By getting rid of excess moisture, it is more hygienic & water does not collect in the bin.Takes a second with use of Zud cleanser, Clorox Green works, Lysol toilet cleaner product, etc.The brush holds up well. After a year of use, still looks and functions as new.You can readily clean without being dependent on a cleaning crew.

"I bought this to get my kids started on an Omega-3 supplement and it's a great idea; however, while it's probably the best option you have for kids, it does not taste good. It has an unpleasant orange taste, certainly OK enough for an adult, and maybe for some kids, but for many kids I think you will have a battle. My daughter will take it mixed in some chocolate yogurt but she's a really good sport. My son HATES it in every combination I've tried so far. It is very hard to mask the dominant orange taste. I am trying it today in a couple of tablespoons of raspberry sorbet and see if that will fly--it might as the supersweet flavor of the sorbet goes a long way to mellowing the orange.

We gave this to my 6 year old son for his birthday in October. Both he and my 3 year old daughter love it!!! We had absolutely no problems setting it up and they have had no problems using it.A previous reviewer had said that the kids could just hit the on/off button and get on your computer and this worried me a little but it isn't true. When you push the on/off button you have to enter the parent password to get it to turn off and go to the computer.My only complaint is the amount of ink we are going through. The kids make so many things and they want to print them all. The feature that allows you to limit the number of prints is a great help with this and I have also defaulted our printer to print in draft mode so that it doesn't use quite as much ink.Overall this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a kid that likes arts and crafts.,toys games,dolls accessories,dolls

I used to have to sweep around the litter box every day, sometimes twice, but now maybe every three days or so if I'm picky about it. The other thing that really surprised me is that although they both dig hard, there's no scratch marks evident after several months of use. These boxes are tough.

"After going through much of the reviews on Amazon about this product I decided to go ahead and purchase it. BIG MISTAKE! Since the first time I used it, I hated it. It does not trim the hair evenly, the blades (or whatever those tiny toothed things are) pull hair which is not very pleasant at all. It takes forever for me to get my desired result because the trimmer has to be held at particular uncomfortable angles and I have to go over the same spot several times.The attachments are rickety and made of the cheapest plastic out there. They are not easy to 'attach' ! The only good thing I can think of so far is that the charging lasts which if it didn't, I would have thrown this not so economically priced piece of junk out the window after the first time I used it.Guys, if you have a thick beard, do not waste your time or your money on this. Sub-standard and a complete utter waste.

"As you can see, there are a lot of positive reviews on Swaddleme. Forget ""baby-gami."" More than a swaddling blanket, this item will really help you put your baby to sleep. We used it for our first child and it worked like magic. From what I've read of baby literature, there is some controversy about swaddling a baby (and for too long). Our son, currently 5 months old, slept in a swaddle me until his 4th month. He is a perfectly happy baby, loves people, and more importantly, has even learned how to sleep on his own (by 5 months). So, I'm not convinced that swaddling does any damage...if anything, mom and baby are happy because they both can rest in those early months.Lastly, here's a tip for folks wanting to extend their swaddleme use. Our son got big FAST -- he's 5 months and 22 pounds. So, he outgrew it pretty quick. But his Japanese grandma was smart",baby products,nursery,unknown

I prefer using sulfate-free shampoo as I have color-treated hair & sulfates strip color.This is a decent shampoo, with pretty good lather for being sulfate free. It smells nice, & it does make my scalp feel a bit cool (literally), which I like. But even after a few weeks, the condition of my scalp hadn't improved. I'd say this is a good product for maintaining a healthy scalp & hair; but if you're really trying to heal an irritated scalp, it probably won't do the trick.

"When I got my keeshond puppy about a year ago, I had trouble finding something that he would like to chew (that he was supposed to chew) until I discovered the wonderful world of ""Bully Sticks"". My vet advised against nylabone (which didn't interest him at all anyway) and rawhide for puppies, so I let my pup browse the pet store shelves and his nose lead him to the Bully Sticks (any nose from afar could smell these out.) I handed one to him and it was love at first bite. They are quite expensive at the pet store, so I was thrilled to see them here on Amazon for such a bargain (compared to pet store prices.) With all the hype about pets getting sick from products made in China, I was also happy to see that these Cadet Bull Sticks are made in Brazil... (though I know USA would be best.)On average, I've been buying 2 packages of these ""Large 1 lb. Bull Sticks"" a month for about a year. At first, my puppy would take at least a whole day to consume one, and it was my sanity saver. Any time I needed my pup to just chill out for a while, I'd give him one of these long Bully Sticks and he wouldn't want to do anything else until it was finished. Yes, they do smell. When you first open the package and if your dog is chewing it by your feet, you will definitely be surrounded by the fresh ""pizzle"" aroma. Remember what these things are made of, though. (It's what makes a bull, a bull. ;) You also may not want your furry best friend to give you kisses while he's chewing it, but the smell does go away quickly and having my dog content and occupied is worth more to me than a brief ""pizzle smell."" Because of their shape, they have not posed a choking hazard to my dog nor do they upset his tummy like many other things do.Now, if I had thought about writing a review on these Large Bull Sticks months ago, I would have given this product 5 stars. I'm rating it 4 stars now because the last couple of recent batches I've gotten, have been very inconsistent in size... most of them pieces around 6 - 8"" long instead of 12"" long, however, they do package them to equal out to be 1 lb. worth of bull sticks, albeit some are short and very thin, some are very short and thick, some are long and thick. (Resisting inappropriate joke...;) My other disappointment with these latest batches is that the price has gone up about $5 from earlier in the year, but it's still a nice value compared to the pet stores. Like someone else has mentioned, they also don't seem to grab the attention of my now 14 month old, 45 lb. keeshond like they used to. The last 2 batches, he'll leave it lying around awhile, but will finish it in about an hour when he does feel like chewing it. I wonder if/what they changed at the manufacturer? Though it's still a must-have for me in my arsenal of items to keep the dog busy.",pet supplies,dogs,treats

It's not the quietest or fastest hairdryer ever, but it does the trick. The only thing that drives me nuts is that I keep hitting the cool button all the time. It's in an awkward place and depresses easily. Overall, it's a strong play if you're looking for a simple, effective dryer.",beauty,hair care,styling tools

The first time I purchased pregnancy tests in the hospital's pharmacy, I got the standardClearblue Easy Pregnancy Test +/- Results, 3-Count""line or no line"" tests, but like many other people, I was confused by the results.

I had to make sure I was not pregnant to start a certain medication and before going in for bloodwork at the lab (and possibly a surprise result), I used one of the Clearblue Easy digital pregnancy tests!

"I've been using these filters for over 20 years. They are excellent filters - just ask some of my catfish which are also 20yrs. old this year!Some of these filters have been running the entire time. I have a separate fish room so I am not bothered by the occasional buzzing of the lids as mentioned in a previous review (putting a small weight on the lid often quiets it down). Some of filters are finally wearing out which is why i purchased a new one. I wouldn't use any other kind. The media never needs replacing - all you do is rinse out and squeeze the sponge under running water until it's clean and put it back into the filter box. You'll never have buy dozens of inserts that constantly need replacing as is the case with other brands of filters. I don't use the charcoal insert but I do rinse out the biomax bag once in a while. One improvement I've made is to cut a hole the size of the intake tube, at least deep enough to cover the holes on the end of the tube, into a one third size piece of an extra foam block. Jam it over end of the intake tube. Cutting it to fit tightly keeps it from falling off. This keeps most of the fouling out of the filter box. So all you'll have to do for months is just take off this extra piece of foam, when the water flow slows down, and wash it under running water then put it back on the intake tube. The sponge in the filter box takes much longer to clog up and need washing this way. Buy an extra foam block for this purpose. I believe fish are more fun the less work you have to do to keep them alive and happy. I run two of the model 70 filters on a 150gal. tank, one of them on 55gal. tanks, and smaller AquaClear models on 20 and 30gal tanks.

"The directions say one or two tablets to relax and three to fight occasional sleeplessness. I've found that it takes three to induce real drowsiness. On the other hand, two are very effective for stopping my brain from its tendency to keep running like a hamster in an exercise wheel. When the wheel slows down, I can usually fall asleep. The sleep is restful and there is no residual groggyness the next day.I also use two tablets when I'm upset or angry about something that happened during the day. It just helps me relax without the downsides of alcohol or other alternatives. Usually, in those cases, if I'm tired, I can then fall asleep naturally.I've used it in combination with melatonin and other mild sleepaids when I know I need to sleep; I'm tense; and I'm just not drowsy. I used in on a transoceanic flight just to help me relax and rest.For me, the bottom line is that Calms Forte won't simply knock me out.

"I'm on my second day of using this body wash, and I'm loving it!!! I'd been looking for a soap that wouldn't dry my skin out, but wasn't full of moisturizers (if my skin is dry, I prefer to use lotion) and wouldn't clog my pores. I already have lots of love for tea tree oil - plus I'm a bit of a eco-conscious hippie - so when I spotted this in Target I thought I'd give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised!1) I personally like the scent. It wasn't quite what I was expecting (not sensing that tea tree oil zing) but I find it pleasant. I can understand how some people would call it an ""old-lady"" scent, but I guess I'm of the mind that not all old ladies smell bad. (;2) I was anticipating a harsher, tingly soap (because of the tea tree oil). This soap is very gentle, and while my skin feels refreshed I don't get that tea-tree-tingle. This could be seen as a pro or con, depending how attached you are to the tea-tree-tingle.3) Despite the lack of tea-tree tingle, this leaves me feeling clean - no greasiness or what have you - and I don't feel dried-out either.3) It lathers REALLY well! ""Natural"" products have been getting better about this over the years, and I think JASON did a really good job with the lather factor.4) Considering this is a ""natural"" product, and is clearly targeted towards a costumer base that will pay more, the price is surprisingly fair. I use about 2 ""pumps"" on a exfoliating washcloth when I shower without feeling cheated.Note",beauty,bath body,cleansers

She slips up and goes back to her old ways sometimes, but it really did help. And, I think it encourages my oldest to drink more, which is good for kidney function. Our three new kittens love it and all 5 of our cats have their favorite ways to drink from it.The one drawback to me, which I knew before I bought it, was the nooks and crannies that are harder to clean than the rest of the fountain.

"OK, I'm not a &quot;stuff&quot; person. When we had our new baby, everyone tried to give us baby items, most of which we politely declined. We figured if our moms raised us without a bunch of designed-just-for-baby gear, we could too. Then came bath time for our 6 week old. Not good. She HATED it and cried so much that we just stopped doing baths all together. After much research, I bought the Safer Bather. Voila! Instant fix. She now loves the bath and has one every night. It dries quickly, takes up very little space and most of all keeps the baby warm and comfy.

"The biggest complaint I have about this product, for me, is that my child is only 20 months and I am trying to teach him numbers and words, in English, which is our first and native language. Unfortunately, because both language buttons are so big and pronounced, he keeps hitting the Spanish button and half the time the toy is speaking in Spanish. I wish the buttons were smaller and underneath the toy (like the sound button), so the parents could decide which language their child is hearing. If I had known the toy would be this way, I would not have purchased it. It's apparent when you first look at it, but when you actually bring it home and your child starts playing with it, you see that unless you want to teach your child to be bilingual at infancy, it's not that helpful.",toys games,electronics for kids,electronic toys

"This is the second spray commander I have purchased. The first one worked wonderfully but unfortunately my dog got into the pool with it on and ruined it. Because it was so effective I decided to purchase another one.I adopted my dog when he was a year old. He had some bad habits which resulted in unnecessary annoying barking or not listening to me when I would call him. If the neighbor's dog came up the the fence, he would go crazy barking and growling at him and the only way I could make him stop was to go over and physically pull him away. Also I could not let him roam freely in our unfenced yard at our vacation home because he would not respect boundaries.I purchased this collar to hopefully remedy these issues. It worked wonders. After only a few times of being sprayed when he was doing something bad (such as walking away from me when I called him, acting like a fool at the fence when the neighbor's dog was there, or getting into something he shouldn't) his behavior improved dramatically. I now trust him completely off leash no matter where we are. He responds much better to my commands and while he still barks, it is much easier to control, and is at more 'appropriate' times. He absolutely HATES the spray, even though it doesn't hurt him, therefore it creates a sufficient distraction which in turn forces him to pay attention to me.I would recommend this to anyone as an effective training tool for correcting undesirable behaviors. My only suggestion would be for it to be waterproof!",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids

"With my fine, stick-straight hair, I had given up on volumizing products that never worked.

No styling, no additional products, and my hair looked noticeably fuller, soft and shiny. My color seems to be staying in much better than it did when I was using other shampoos, so I think it's worth the money.Update, 06/20/2008Still using the original bottles that I bought back in March, and still really liking it. With other shampoos, my color faded quickly and looked brassy. I can use this every day with very little fading--there will always be some--so I'm happy, and a little goes a long way.

"Well, I have owned the I-Que now for a couple of weeks and I must say that it is a great little robot. It's not THE most technologically advanced device available, but it does do the trick. I guess if there was a way to combine the AIBO and the I-Que it would be great. The robot has a lot of fun and entertaining data stored and it does remember some of the stuff you input in to it's tiny memory. The only backdraw and also the only reason I rated this toy 4 stars is that the sensors, as in so many of the cheaper robots, are somewhat useless. If the robot drives, and it does this very slow, and encounters an obstacle, it gets stuck most of the times and you could run the risk of burning out the motor or damaging the gears. I think that this is a minor setback though since this robot wasn't developed for pure autonomy but rather with having the user be within eyesight and able to assist the robot when needed. I recommend this toy to any robot enthusiast out there as it brings fun and entertainment to the whole family. The expandable memory makes it more fun and adds years to it's use.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown

"We love this product. After 5 1/2 weeks in the NICU with our baby (born at 31 weeks) we were very accustomed our baby being monitored. We bought this product and have been using it for a week now and it works great. We know it probably isn't foolproof, but it is a tool to help us keep the baby safe. For those who complained of false alarms (of which I read many reviews), I would argue that perhaps they weren't false. After our hospital experience, we now know babies do stop breathing. Apnea/Bradychardias are the main reason preemies don't get discharged. Every incident the baby has moves your discharge date back a week. And incidents happen often (mostly while eating, but also while sleeping). If your baby isn't hooked to a monitor, you'd often never realize it. So I believe that many of these ""false alarms"" people are complaining about are probably legitimate. I highly recommend this product-just keep in mind it is just a tool and diligence is still required in keeping your baby safe.",baby products,safety,monitors

"After years of telling myself, ""This is the year that I learn how to play chess,"" and trying to memorize how the pieces move and what the end goal is, I finally learned how to play last night. Actually, my 10 year old son and I both learned how and have played on-and-off all day today.I read about No Stress Chess over a year ago, but I was afraid it would be like a paint-by-number set, providing some results and perhaps even some satisfaction but leaving you just as unable to advance on your own as you were when you started. Not the case at all with NSC.Using a deck of cards, each player is limited to the well-described moves on the card drawn. As players advance, the number of choices increases at each level until you're ready to turn the board over to a standard board and play. Within 30 minutes, my son and I (again, neither of us knew anything about chess) were ready to do away with the cards and play. We still have a lot to learn about strategy, but we're playing and having fun.Beats the heck out of the Chess for Morons, or something equally denigrating, that I tried to learn from.",toys games,games,board games

"7-Keto purports to be a lowered-risk-of side effects form of DHEA, an androgenic steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, which are about the size of ping-pong balls and located on top of your kidneys, and, not surprisingly, excreted in urine. Among other things, the adrenal glands function as the control center for the well-known ""fight or flight"" response but ongoing constant stress may create adrenal fatigue or even exhaustion, thus low levels of DHEA (which decreases with age anyway) may aggravate chronic fatigue, depression and decreased sex drive, among other things. However, since DHEA is the precursor hormone to estrogen, progesterone and testosterone poduction, this is no mere ""fountain of youth"" weight-loss aiding nutritional suppement skin and libido candy. Some doctors have asked the FDA to seriously consider whether DHEA and it's newer cousin, 7-Keto, should even be sold without formal counseling of some type. Proponents claim that since formal Western medicin is great at treating full-fledged disease but less skilled (right now) at prevention and reversal of precursor conditions, judicious use of DHEA or this newer and allegedly improved form, 7-Keto, is just another one of those buyer beware situations, and there are a lot worse things one can do legally to one's body than ingest a single supplement daily in this category. Some users claim that this supplement helps with kicking caffeine and other stimulants. Anyway, TwinLab makes quality products, I have a few whiskers on my chinny-chin-chin anyway, and I don't take birth control pills or estrogen supplements, so I don't feel as if I am overdoing it from another direction. And at less than [...] a bottle, I'm eager to see if a two-month course of 7-Keto supplementation helps me gain lean muscle mass and feel friskier overall, but it will be hard to tell since I've been working out more and eating better anyway. So, it's a great value, but a potent form of a supplement some feel is a little risky anyway, so use your own judgment.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

Find it locally or find an unbreakable plastic item to order through the mail. Chances are that any ceramic pot like this one 'may' break in the mail, like it did to me, and then you will have to go through the return process - which by the way, is as painless as I have seen all credit to Amazon.com (part of why I am a very frequent shopper here).

And what I like about this is that they come in varieties (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc.), so I won't be eating the same thing every time, which is also good. If you're in a rush in the morning and want something to grab and go within a 15 minute period, I recommend this to you. Also you don't have to waiste your dishes, because they come in their own plastic bowls.My only problem is that they are so small, and after about 10 spoon fulls, it's all gone. Sometimes I'm still hungry after eating one packet (and I'm skinny too).True this contains Trans Fats, what breakfast item that kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them? Not very many items. Maybe eggs, and whatnot. Also if your kids are somewhat active in somekind of fitness activities, those ""deadly trans fats"" should be worked off by the end of the day.

This is the only product I've found that does the trick, and I totally rely on it to protect me now. I don't wear makeup, and when I most need sun protection is when I least can tolerate a moisturizer, and at those times I just use this right on my skin (they say to use it over moisturizer). For arms & exposed legs I use the colorless, higher-SPF one (in the blue tube). At first I couldn't believe it could work, since it sinks right in to the skin & doesn't feel nasty or slimy like other sunscreens, but it does!I wish it were less expensive, but one look in the mirror at my skin graft scars reminds me that protection is worth it.

Our oldest son will stand & ride every time. Now we are using it with our Graco carrier, and the boys are facing each other. I would have given it five stars, but when you're using the carrier, it's impossible to access the storage basket (I read where someone had a zipper put in a different stroller's basket, so I might try that), and no cup holder or anything for storage for the parents.

"The good news is that the gate arrived undamaged and was in its intended position in about 15 minutes. It is simple to install and while others seemed to struggle with it, I didn't find it very challenging. For openings of 29-31, 34-36, 39-41 and 44-46, this gate should work pretty well. Beyond those ranges, the gate pretty much operates at the end range of the tension bolts and perhaps that is why previous reviewers have voiced some concerns about it not fitting snugly for their door. When square, the door closes easily. I'm using a bungee cord to keep it open. It is sturdy.The bad news is that the company has no pride in their product. Mine, like other reviewers have noted, was dirty AND rusty. Had I bought this at Target, it would have gone back in an instant as it is inexcusable. The black dust covering it came off with a wet sponge. I couldn't find anything to take out the rust. And I'm not just talking about a little rust. There are at least 20 splotches of rust on this gate. Unfortunately, I bought it through Amazon so I would have to cart my behind to UPS, pay for shipping and then buy something else and perhaps pay for that shipping, too. As my dogs are old and I'm not likely going to use it very long, I'm just going to keep it and be done with it. That being said, I'd buy something else if I could do it over again.

"This stuff tastes like chocolaty cookie dough. I really like it. 24 of these is a lot of little packets, so they're good value. And, they're little. I'd never get even close to full on one of these, but they're a great snack when I just want something small. Probably the equivalent of a spoonful of cookie dough.Most chocolate flavored nutritional stuff doesn't even taste like chocolate, so I was surprised this actually tastes like chocolate.The ""Litter Leash"" feature is really cool, because this prevents you from getting rid of the top. It keeps the tiny part you usually discard, attached to the rest of it. I didn't realize that's what the ""Litter Leash"" did until I looked carefully at the packet, so the first one of these I ate, I practically destroyed the whole thing. I thought it was super cool after, though.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks

"I still have my 1.6oz bottle of Lacoste pour homme that I purchased from Macy's 6 years ago, and the difference between that and what I received (I got two 3.3 oz) is like night and day. The original I have from 6 years ago is strong, and wonderful smelling. I only need one spray and I can easily smell it on all parts I tagged. I tested both bottles I received against my original, and I can barely smell either of them at all even after three sprays. There's a lingering trace of what Lacoste pour homme is supposed to be, but it is so weak (like it's watered down heavily) that I am better off not wearing it at all.I contacted the seller today and if I hear back, I'll update.In the meantime, I'll check to see if Macy's is still selling it and if it still smells like it's supposed to.",beauty,fragrance,men s

I had one cat who went crazy for them, have one cat who likes to play with them just as much as any toy, and have another who couldn't care less about them.

Unfortunately, by the 5th day, the squeaker no longer worked so she doesnt want to play with it as much. I think for the price they could of put in a higher quality squeaker.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"It's good to learn what your BA level is after having X number of drinks, X amount of time has elapsed and how much food you've eaten. Take notes a few times and pretty soon you really don't need to test your BA level. You just know from past results what to expect. Be sure not to test yourself if you've eaten or had anything to drink in the last 20 minutes as this can alter test results. Also the instructions say that sometime in advance of using this tester you should ""prime"" the tester (while completely sober of course) by blowing into it for 5 seconds (after not having anything to eat for the last 30 minutes).

"Kirk's Castile Original Coco soap is perfect for those that do not wish to have animal by- products in their soaps, nor use products tested on animals. The information contained on the packaging clearly states that there are no synthetic detergents or animal by-products. The glycerin used in the soap is vegetable and the rest of the formula is quite simple. I had been looking for a vegetarian friendly soap, and found it in this product that has been around since 1839. The soap provides a rich lather, and washes off better than many of the soaps on the market. The fragrance of the soap is pleasant and not overbearing. The soap does seem to last a shorter time, but the results on the skin and the knowledge that the soap is all natural and guilt free makes it worth buying a bit more frequently. I am surprised organizations that promote vegetarian lifestyles do not mention this soap,as I could have used it years ago. Besides buying it on Amazon, it's also available in major grocery stores (Fry's, Safeway, etc) and independent stores, as well as Kirk's on-line.",beauty,skin care,hands nails
"We bought this toy (with several other Fisher Price toys) when my daughter was around 6 months old (about 8 months ago),and she really seems to be enjoying it more now than before.She likes pressing the little animals and hearing them either count or make exclamations (depending on the mode), but her favorite is pulling the measuring tape and hearing the songs it sings (either abcs or the toolbox song).It comes with a little hammer for using to hit the animal's heads, which I didn't like (who needs to teach their kids to start hitting?), but she likes taking the hammer off and playing with it seperately (she pushes down the animals with her hands).I think it is a harder toy for babies because it takes some effort to push down the animals (and even pulling the tape is not easy), but would be enjoyable for you to play with them.This was a good addition to our toy collection.",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters

I bought this chair to be my primary seat for watching TV, etc., but the seat cushion is very thin and not too comfortable. I have had backaches, mostly up in the shoulder-blade area since using it.I will not bother to send it back, just because I figure it will be too much of a hassle, and it will probably end up as a side chair somewhere else in the house.It was inexpensive compared to other chairs I looked at; so I guess that phrase ""you get what you pay for"" would apply to this purchase.",baby products,nursery,furniture

"I was a little worried by the negative reviews I read of this product, but I went ahead and gave it a shot. Weeks later now, and it's the best purchase I've ever made for my dog!The ball does have a strong chemical odor when you first get it, but it fades quickly. With kibble inside, it was no turn-off for my dog. You cannot open it, so don't put messy treats inside--I just put my dog's kibble in it, and wash the outside from time to time, and it's perfectly clean. The material it's made of is relatively soft, which is both good and bad--good because that means it's kind to my furniture and hardwood floors, and not too noisy, but bad because it's no match for a chewing dog. Luckily my girl is not a chewer, but if you have a dog who likes to chew you will want to supervise him/her with this toy. Also, it's way trickier to get kibble out than it looks, and the only reliable way to get it all is to just keep rolling it and rolling it. If your dog is lazy, none too smart, or prone to frustration, maybe reconsider getting this toy. If you have an ADD herder or other smart, active dog, this toy is a godsend.That said, my dog absolutely adores it. It took her a few minutes to 'get' it, but after that it was pure love. The little craters on the ball make it easy to grip so your dog can easily carry it around, and its bright color makes it easy to find if your dog misplaces it (say, under a bed). My dog actually prefers this ball to her bowl at meal times! She ditches her bowl, with food in it, if she sees me get this ball. If you have a smart dog who could use some more interest in his life, you will LOVE this ball. As an added bonus, your company will be very entertained by your dog playing with this toy--it's adorable.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"I remember this being my favorite board game to play with my brothers when I was a kid. I bought it for my own children (aged 3-11) this year and it has been a hit. It is fun game for itself and not just something to be endured for the children's sake (like never ending games of Candyland).This is an excellent board game for parents to play with their children. I would recommend that kids be at least 5, but younger kids can play because it doesn't require reading. It is a fun combination of memory and luck. The board game is in a fairy tale setting with interesting pictures to look at. I rated this 4 for educational value because it is designed to be fun, not to teach something. It is also more durable than the average board game, but it is a board game and can be crushed or damaged by a determined child so I gave it a 4 for durability.",toys games,games,board games

The first couple of shaves did irritate my neck area, but after a few days that was not an issue anymore.

"I am not the type to shave using a razor blade in personal areas- but this groomer does a fine job of shaving the groin area without giving you the worry of ever getting nicked. I have been using this for almost a year now.Holds its charge very well, very well made. The trimmer is not so great unless you have alot of body hair. The adjustable wheel is a nice feature, but once again only if you are extremely hairy will this feature even work. I use it on setting 1 and it just gets my hair trimmed barely, I guess Im jsut not super hairy LOLThe attachment pop on and off very easily. And its nice you can use the trimmer without the trimmer guard on it for shaving sideburns etc.All in all I highly recommend this item,And for those that are looking for a product to shave your genitals I found this to work better than - the Seiko Clean Cut- I have never tried the Body Bare though",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"the other reviewers speak the truth - this is just way too much fun. i bought this for a girlfriend who likes kaleidoscopes. not knowing too much about them one way or the other, i based my purchase on all of the glowing reviews.when it arrived i was pleased to see that i could open the package surreptitiously so that could see for myself how it worked. well, that turned out to be a mistake, because at least a month passed before i could bear to part with it. every day i went to put it back in the package, and every day i ended up playing with it instead.The skinny cylinder filled with both colored 'sand' and zillions of sparkly bits fits into a hole drilled at a 90 degree angle to the kaleidoscope proper, and then the 'scope is turned so that the cylinder is at vertical. after the sand and sparkles have slowly drizzled their way through to the bottom, rotate 180 degrees and repeat.it's so easy to use that even the youngest child can enjoy it, and it's so sturdy (the skinny cylinder fits VERY snugly into the 'scope, so there is no chance whatsoever of it falling out) that i doubt it could pose a danger to anyone unless it were thrown at them. a bargain at twice the price, as they say. just be warned - you're better off buying two at once, (because it's very likely you'll want one), rather than buying a second one later and paying duplicate shipping.purists may quibble because it is not a 'true' kaleidoscope, in the sense that you do not peer through it at a light source, but i don't think anyone else would complain. my girlfriend was thrilled, and tells me she and her two kids fight over whose turn it is to play with it.",toys games,novelty gag toys,prisms kaleidoscopes

"This cartridge allows the child to choose from one of several race tracks to ""race"" on. Unfortunately, the activities or goals of each track are very similar. You either steer left or right to choose a letter/number/symbol. More time is spent on speeding up to grab a coin, jumping over oncoming dangers, or speeding ahead. As such, the educational value is really limited, while the video game aspect is what might keep a child playing. There is really no depth and very little thought behind each track. My son was bored immediately. It reminded me of an old-fashioned video game from my youth (70s). Very very disappointing. We bought this cartridge with the Disney Princesses cartridge for my daughter, and there is no comparison. The Princesses cartridges allows one to use the pen as well as the arrow keys (with ""Cars"", only arrows), has memory games, practice drawing letters, recognizing words beginning with letters, and many more, varied, learning exercises, while at the same time using fun graphics, stories and songs.

I don't know if it's the smell or the very nice action of the medicine but she's both calm and coughs a LOT less (like 1/2 cough the whole night) compared to the night before I used it on her and her waking up 3 times from coughing.

"I've been using this hair straightener for about 4 years now. I originally used a Solano Blue Sapphire straightener and when it finally died, I freaked out. My hair dresser suggested this over the Chi that I was debating about and it worked great! I am on #2 though, because I wasn't careful about how I stored the original. I used to just wrap the cord around the iron, and I later learned this is a big no-no. Eventually it messed up some of the wires at the base of the iron and I would have to push them in and hold it at a funny angle to get the iron to heat up.Eventually I just dumped it and got a new one, and I am much more careful about storage. It works fantastic - it heats up super fast, just a few strokes and your hair is totally straight, but it's not cheap, so do yourself a favor and do not wrap the cord around it when you're not using it. I learned that lesson the hard way. I don't fault the product for that either, I completely blame myself. I've had my last one for over 2 years now and I haven't had any issues with it.It works quick, it's light weight (unlike my original Solano that I loved so dearly), it doesn't pull your hair, you can use it to make curls as well as straighten, etc. I really think this is one of the best hair irons on the market - but take care of it so it lasts a long time!",beauty,hair care,styling tools

Because my husband is a contractor, he was able to install screws with toggles, to ensure that the door would not continually fall apart. Also we installed the door in a standard 6x2 wall and the door was not deep enough. Even though we were able to make our own nesessary repairs to the door so that it was functional, we are very displeased with the construction and quality of this product.

As for everyone complaining they leak, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I read a recent review saying she didn't know why they left room between the threads that screw on the cap & nipple, the bottle info explicitly says this is to let air vent out, that is why they leak when you screw the cap on too tight.

Now it is 19 DPO and I have a dark line almost the same as the control.I do have to note that I took a few tests for fun at the same time to see the consistency of the line darkness and they did vary in intensity (one was super light). Not a big deal because if you get a line it's a positive, but could make a difference if you are testing super early.They work and the only reason to pay more for a name brand is if you want a pretty picture with it (hey I did it!).",health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives
"I have shoulder length, extremely curly, frizzy, coarse, out of control hair. The slightest humidity wrecks my hair style. I suffered with this all my life and finally, a few years ago, started to get the Japanese Straightening done every four months. Expensive, but worth it. The treated hair never curls again. However, after about two months the roots start to grow in and since I am now spoiled, I wanted to use something that would easily straighten the roots (the most difficult part) and that I could use on the treated hair as well so it is smooth and shiny.I bought this originally for $59.00 but just got it here on Amazon for my (twin) sister for $39.99. The only other place I have seen it that price was Marshalls. I can't express how well it works, but it does take a little effort to learn how to use effectively. You need to hold the hair tight in sections when the hair is still fairly damp/wet and pull the brush section through slowly, numerous times until the hair is completely dry. If you do that you will be very happy with the results. The difference between using this and just sectioning off my hair and drying with a regular dryer and brush is night and day. The roots are totally straight.Again, Japanese Straightening is a miracle treatment for me...nothing works like that does but it is very expensive ($400 with tip every 4 months for my hair). Since I am by no means wealthy, you can imagine how fantastic it must work and how out of control my hair is. To also extol the virtues of this product...well you get the point. It takes practice but I mastered it with the first use.For anyone who said it was crap...they just did not know how to use it or expected it not to burn their hair if they left it on one spot for too long...any hot hair product will burn if not used properly. I highly recommend this product.",beauty,hair care,styling tools

My son was eating almost 2oz at six days old--way more than he should have been. This is because the bottles we were using let him eat too fast and I didn't know any better. After switching we were able to get him to slow down and have had fewer gas problems. I have had the bottle leak but it easily fixed by rescrewing on the top (I was relieved to see that other people had the same problem--I blamed it on being tired).

"This is something that is important for protecting one's investment. A RV heater is fairly expensive, but the hard part is getting to it. Plus, it also requires a lot of connections to work right, the air ducts, the propane system, the 12VDC system for the electronic thermostat and fans, which is a lot of labor.Attaching these onto the vents is a no brainer -- use the including pushing tool to attach the spring onto the existing vent protector. Only reservation of mine is that if that one small spring breaks, off goes the screen. I might see about caulking the edge with Dicor or something heat-resistant as additional insurance, but so far, it has held up without any problems.Here in Texas, hornets and mud dauber wasps get almost anywhere that isn't screened, so making sure they stay out of your RV ducting is important.",toys games,games,unknown

"Good - What it isThis is a quick protein boost for your hair that you can use fairly often. If you're experiencing mild breakage, this is a way to get your hair into shape quickly. If you are experiencing moderate breakage, using this on a schedule is a great way to gradually improve the quality of your hair without accidentally overdoing it. Furthermore, plenty of people use this without following up with a DC and retain softness. I personally have never done protein without a moisture DC immediately after, so I can't comment on that.Bad - What it isn'tIf you want a quick MEDIUM/LARGE protein boost, you're better off using ORS Mayo or perhaps that 2 Step.

"Better in than some, worse than others. The dial allows you to set the temperature and is good at keeping the temp. consistent which is great. However, aside from the actual heating is the construction. Because of its shape it will not work for a anything smaller than a 2.5 Mini Bow or for tanks w/o straight sides.This is not because you can't control the temp. finely enough, but because the large mounting piece needs to be above water, outside of the tank and attached to a straight edge. While the package does say non-submersible, I didn't think there would be so much of it that wasn't submersible, and the thumbnail for this isn't helpful at all. The water line is also very high. You will have to keep a careful eye on evaporation.Also, when the water temp. is close enough to cause the heater to shut off, there is a period of hesitation where the heater is almost on but not quite.

But the violin sound is incredibly fake and unrealistic, so it's not a good way to introduce baby to the sound of a real violin at all. And when you play the Orchestra mode, so all the instruments play at the same time, I often have to turn off the violin sound just so it's not so unpleasant to listen to. The volume is not a problem for me at all, I know others complained it was too loud but I think the volume was good (you're not using this toy at bedtime, it's a daytime active playtime toy).

I get upset because it is wonderful coffee and I guess I have just become addicted to it. If you haven't tried it do so the first chance you get.

"I purchased this item based on Avent being associated with high quality products. That is not the case with these pads. They are not very absorbant, especially for nighttime use, are too bulky to wear under anything but an extra large sweatshirt, and worst of all they stick to your nipples, increasing dryness, cracking and bleeding. It is a wonderful idea being able to reuse them, but not a workable one.

"Nexus used to be my favorite hair product brand because they used high quality ingredients that did wonders for my hair. But in the last 3 years they have repeatedly tampered with their formulas to cheapen their products and still charge high prices.I used to love Humectress conditioner. It used to be a rich thick formula that left my hair incredibly hydrated and nourished. Then they changed the formula about three years ago to cheapen it. Now it appears that this year they have cheapened it even worse. It's just a cheap or mediocre conditioner now, not worth the price they are charging for something that is no longer salon quality.As soon as I tried this recent version it gave me an huge rash on my neck. I couldn't figure where the rash came from because I stopped using it for several months (despite buying the 33 ounce bottle) because it was no longer a great conditioner. When I tried it again to use up the bottle, the rash re-appeared. Rashes are individual, not everyone will react the same way, but it was obvious to me that cheapening of the ingredients has consequences in quality beyond just not making it worth the cost.Google all the complaints on the internet for more info. Basically they have kept the same names on their products but completely changed the ingredients, misleading customers, into believing it's the same product. None of their products are the same as they were 3 years ago. It's basically either crap or mediocre stuff pretending to be what it used to be.Many of the reviews on Amazon are from BEFORE Nexus started selling mediocre products in place of the wonderful stuff they used to produce.",beauty,hair care,conditioners

"This dog food is the best!! Excellent price. Free shipping, and above all high grade quality ingedients. No fillers, no by products, no wheat, no corn. I have a puppy that started out looking like a beagle puppy, 3.lbs 6 oz when I got him at 8 wks. He turned out to be just barely 4 wks old and is now 45 pounds and growing. I think he is actually a coon hound. He has itchy skin so I wanted to find a product he could eat and my 13 yr old wonder dog (we wonder what he is)could also eat. Canidae is the perfect answer. Since I have been using Canidae my puppy is far less itchy and I still am at the 3 parts Canidae to one part of his other food, which was Pedigree for puppies.

"I agree with a previous reviewer that this toy is best for a medium-sized dog. The goose is a little plump so it's harder for a smaller dog to squeak it. I have a medium-sized dog and his specialty is ripping the squeaker and stuffing out of toys.

If you're dog is a ""killer"" these AKC toys are very easy to tear apart, but luckily they're cute and fairly cheap so I don't mind.

They were more concerned with trying to get out than playing. I am really careful when I take them outside because once they realize they are there occasionally they will try to get out. If you have it on them properly and you're paying attention you can quickly realize what they're doing and stop them!

"What can I say - our little girl adores her mobile. It has helped us settle her into sleep at night and has given us a few extra minutes to get things set-up in the morning when she starts to wake. As a product I can't say enough about it. It is well made and has some features that we found extremely thoughtful:1) The motion stops every few seconds to give the baby a chance to focus. After a few seconds it starts to move again.2) It automatically stops after 20 minutes -- I think the music actually gets quiter towards the end.3) It has a very useful volume control on the base. This is something reviewers pointed out was missing in some of the other products available here.4) While the remote control seems like a bit of gadget, it works well and has come in handy.5) The reversible bling-blings (is that the technical term?) are a nice idea... although we haven't flipped them yet to the more complex side(&gt; 2 mos.).

"To start off, I really don't have a huge amount of experience using different razors. I didn't have thick facial hair during highschool, so I found using an electric every other day was sufficient. However, later on, when being clean shaven was called for by my work, I found myself using the free Gilette Mach 3 which I received in the mail. I loved the Mach 3 and after using it exclusively for years, I switched to the Gilette Fusion when it first came out. Although I preferred the Mach 3 at first, I have gotten used to the Fusion over time and have come to appreciate it.I was not aware how much I loved the Gilette Fusion until I tried the Shick Quattro. My Fusion blades gradually grew dull over time, so I decided to try the free Quattro I received in the mail. WHAT A SHOCK.To begin with, I immediately noticed the significant weight difference between the Quattro and the Fusion. The Fusion is probably about three times as heavy as the Quattro, and it simply feels more solid in my hand. I was surprised at how cheap and flimsy the Quattro felt in my hand. But perhaps the most apparent difference was that with the Quattro, the five o'clock shadow becomes the noontime shadow. The shave is simply not close enough. It fails miserably in this department, I start noticing stubble appear before the day is even half over.So in closing... I would avoid this razor at all costs. Even if I got another for free.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"It is worth noting that these come in at least two sizes. The size sold here is medium, though it doesn't say so anywhere in the listing, unless they've revised it since this writing. I'm a male who wears size 9.5 or 10 shoes, and these were too small for me. Top to bottom they were so small that I couldn't fit the flanges over and under my toes. The front of the package says, ""medium - fits most."" But the back states that medium is intended for men up through size 9.I returned mine and bought the large ones from an Amazon Seller here on the site that specifies size large. They were a little more expensive, but I'm satisfied with the product; I wear mine most days with shoes and boots and feel little discomfort and, obviously, they are firmer than the gel type, which I appreciate.I'd give the product itself a five star rating, but I feel the size issue is important enough that I should draw attention to it. Almost three weeks after returning the medium pair to Amazon, and telling them their inadequate description was the reason, they still haven't revised the listing. I will change my rating when Amazon revises the description.",health personal care,health care,foot care
"This is a gift for me and I am 70 years old! I have a few ""special"" Barbies that I have collected over the years, not many, only four or five, but each one is special to me in some way. This particular one because she is the 2007 Christmas model, dressed in red with a white fur headband. I love the Christmas clothing, it gives her such a ""Holiday"" look. As for whether or not it is an ""educational"" toy, I don't see how a Barbie Doll can be educational to anyone, but she is very beautiful and lovely in appearance and that is all that is required of a Barbie doll. Don't you agree? And as to whether or not it is ""durable"" it will be as long as I have it, but in the hands of a small child, I would say that it would look like any other doll that a little girl has, the hair would be tangled and messy, and the clothes would probably be missing because little girls love removing the clothes of their dolls, and they eventually (the clothes) get lost, however the doll would still be what is was minus the clothes and fancy hair-do, so yes, I would say it is ""durable."" However, with me, it will not be taken out of the box in my lifetime, and I hope that whichever great granddaughter of mine that inherits it will treasure it and take as good of care of it as I have.

My problem with Zeno has been that the device is completely unreliable, and I have encountered the exact same problem not once, twice, but three times, so I am finished with Zeno.

The device is fully charged, but flashes and makes a noise, then shuts off. This has been the exact same problem for every single Zeno device I have owned, but the last one was by far the biggest joke, since the others lasted a few months. I had a replacement tip, so the issue wasn't the tip needing replacing- it's the device, it's truly a hunk of junk.

"I was amazed at the design of this product. It's designed to be shaky, and when it's put together it actually works, which is more than I can say for some Hot Wheels kits. It wobbles as the car goes around, the car bounces off the rail and turns in the ""spin out turn"" as it's supposed to, and there is a spinning wheel that is turned by the shaking of the track. When you press a lever, the car goes through the wheel that has gaps that happen to be in the right place at the right time for the car to go through before dropping the car onto an arm that puts it on the ground.I bought this product for my 6 yr old's birthday two weeks ago. My 7 yr old put it together and did a pretty good job (I had to make sure things were put together correctly otherwise the turn and wheel would not work right) and they have played with it ever since. It costs about the same as a comparable Hot Wheels kit.

"My son (10 years old) had been suffering from severe constipation for several years. We went from doctor to doctor and despite making changes to his diet and trying several medicines, he continued to suffer from it. Triphala has been a blessing and since he has started it, his problem has gone away. He has been taking it for a few months now, and an Ayurvedic doctor advised us that it can be taken for any period of time with no side effects. I am writing this so that if you have a child who suffers from constipation, you can give this miraculous mixture of herbs to help relieve the problem. Unlike medicines for constipation, Triphala improves appetite and general health and has no harmful side-effects. One teaspoon of Triphala in a cup of water (with, optionally, a teaspoon of honey added to it) taken at night half an hour after dinner helps in regularity.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"My 8 year old son started wetting the bed consistently at maybe 3 or 4 years old. He was a pretty dry kid at night before that. Nothing big changed in our lives, my husband's brother wet the bed until a pretty old age, or ped. just chalked it up to that. Well, both him and my 5 year old (another story altogether I guess) were both used to wearing underwear at night and I didn't have the heart (or frankly the money) to put them into pull-ups at night. Nothing against parents that use them, it just seemed to make them feel really badly when my husband and I discussed using them. This alarm works great. If you have it clipped in the right spot it senses the wetness when there is just a drop or two. I should probably read the directions again. We've had this alarm for over a year and this is the first time we've committed to use it every night. My son wakes up almost every night with it. The thing is, it wakes him up and he takes care of it himself. He goes to the bathroom and changes his underwear. Then he comes to me to help clip it back on. Probably 95% of the time, it's only his underwear that are a little wet. His pajamas and bed are dry. It's nice only having to wash one set (5 year old's) of sheets a night! BUT I'm not sure if this is helping get to the root of the problem or not. He doesn't seem to be waking up on his own yet. Sometimes he holds it all night though. It's probably been 8-10 weeks since we started using it. I just hope we can get past this and then start working with my other son (he'll be 6 in Dec. Also, just to make sure it detects the wetness right away, I clip it inside the ""flap"" area. Not sure what to call that but it seems to help that there's not an extra layer of fabric in the way. He's only wet really bad a few times, and out of those few times it's usually been when I was gone and he clipped it on himself. My husband thought he knew how to do it.Hope this helps....I do think the product itself does what it says. We've had no problems with the function of it.",health personal care,health care,incontinence

"I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet! Nonetheless, a few things I noted. First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured. They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it. That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow. Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides! The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head! The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at! Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat. I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review. On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!",baby products,gear,swings

"We played A Taste for Wine and Murder on New Years Eve. We all had a fantastic time. The game is well organized with 3 different menu suggestions with shopping lists and recipes. The clues were well laid out and the costume suggestions helped us all be even more creative. Everyone really got into their character, which is a must for a successful murder mystery party. The game took about 3 hours to complete which was perfect to pass the time on New Years Eve. Only two of us guessed who the murder was in the end. The game was even fun for the non-suspects (Bud Wizer and Bonny Lass) even though we didn't have any secrets to reveal. The only thing that could have been improved was the CD - it was a little cheezy and still referred to itself as a casset tape (that could be updated!).

"Okay first I have to tell you that for the past 2 years I have had the stroller from HELL! I received as a gift when my daughter was born, never bought another one at the risk of offending my inlaws!So now when my son was born, I began to do the research into which double stroller I would buy because I was not going to push another beast around for 2 more years! (Seriously! I had the Graco Eddie Bauer single stroller and UGGGHHH it has a mind of it's own!)So anyways I researched every double stroller they sell and decided on the ARIA TWIN and all I can say is I LOVE IT, it is so easy to push and steer, easier than I could even imagine after my old stroller! It is to easy to put up and down, SO lightweight, weighs less than my single stroller by quite alot, fits through every door with no problems! I wanted a side by side too So I am very pleased with that!The seats are great for both my toddler and baby, they recline wonderfully to any position, they also go all the way upright for my toddler, which is a biggie to my daughter, she no longer has to pull herself upright because the seat did not go far enough upright in the last stroller we had!The basket is huge, I love it, I have not filled it up with lots of stuff yet but it seems great and plenty big enough for lots of stuff! I also bought a couple extra hooks to hang bangs onto the stroller if I need more space, a great idea for bags or your purse if you need more space!Yes, the parent cup holder is too small and pretty useless but for less than $10 you get buy a new one and put it on there, No big deal to me if I love my stroller!Over all it is well worth the money and although I may have had my reservations about spending that much on a stroller when I could have spent less, I am glad I bought this one and I have no regrets at all!

"I really like to cook and I cook a wide variety of cuisines. I was quite eager to sample this product, advertised as both a marinade and a finishing sauce. Essentially what it is -- is a very high quality ""sweet and sour"" type sauce.I found the mango-ginger combination to be quite tasty. The flavor was fresh and bright and would complement grilled chicken and pork. It would be equally good for dipping various Chinese-style appetizers. However, I was somewhat disappointed (hence the lack of a 5th star) because the habanero flavor was minimal. Both heat and flavor were barely discernable. When one sees ""habanero"" on a label, one expects a significant ""kick"". In this product, the ""kick"" was definitely lacking.A very good product nonetheless.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown

"Many years ago, I was browsing through Sacks Fifth Ave., looking for a fresh, spring/summer scent that would suit me. The saleswoman was extremely helpful, and spent some time discussing various perfumes with me, as well as spritzing different paper strips with sample scent, rather than my arm. I preferred light, transparent woodsy scents - subtle. Chanel had just launched a new perfume, in 1974, which combined the fresh, fruity tang of lemon from Italy, light spring floral notes of Honeysuckle and Water Hyacinth, and pulled it all together with the woodsy charm of Vetiver and oakmoss.Vetiver has a delightful smoky woodsy fragrance which is frequently blended with geranium and jasmine. It is a tall, dense, wild grass with long narrow leaves and a strand of underground white, yellow and brown roots and is sought after for its calming, protective, soothing and uplifting characteristics. Vetiver can be found in Java, Haiti, Japan, Indonesia and South India.I find it goes deliciously well with the above ingredients and leaves one feeling clean, fresh, intimate and very sexy. There is no astringent smell or feel to Cristalle, unlike many ""fresh scents,"" nor is it too heady or heavy. Cristalle is a stimulating fragrance and an excellent perfume for day wear, especially in warm weather and for sports. I also wear it on warm evenings as I prefer the crisp, woodsy scent to the sweeter flowery ones in the heat. Because it is so subtle, it is ideal for the workplace also, used sparingly.Chanel relaunched Cristalle in 1993 with a richer floral blend in the eau de parfum concentration with a slightly fruiter chypre base. The changes did not impact my opinion at all. It is still an outstanding fragrance, one of my very few favorites.I have worn ""Cristalle"" for thirty years now, and it has carried me through various life phases beautifully and smoothly. An absolute feel good perfume! ENJOY!PS - I just noted that one of the other reviewers mentions that Chris Noth (""Law & Order,"" ""Sex in the City""), is Wowed by Cristalle!

To my profound relief, she began recovering immediately. She was feline leukemia positive, with both pneumonia and a deep tissue infection, neither of which responded to antibiotics. I kept up the Eqstim treatment for 2 weeks. She eventually died of cancer but I was able to extend her life, with quality, for 7 months, a significant amount considering it was a fourth of her age.

Since starting on Cholodin about a month ago, she hasn't had a single episode of aggression and seems like a new dog. All of her ""alpha dog"" behaviors have disappeared. We are tapering her off the amitriptyline, and she's now only on 1/4 of the dose. This is the first time we've been able to reduce the dose. I have every confidence that we'll be able to get her completely off the drug. I'm completely sold on the Cholodin.

"Even non-dieters love these. 1 box, made as per instructions (I use a 6oz container of nonfat vanilla yogurt usually) makes 1 pan, but I find that it makes a decently thick brownie if you use an 8x8 pan and adjust cooking time accordingly. I couldn't spread the whole batter out into a larger pan. The batter is very thick and when all you are adding to the box of powder mix is a small carton of yogurt, it seems unlikely that that small amount of yogurt will turn a bowl of powder into a bowl of batter but if you keep stirring, it does happen. I also tried it using nonfat plain Greek yogurt plus a tsp of vanilla but it was too thick so I had to add a few tablespoons of water and then the batter came out perfect and the brownies were just as great as always. I like that you can do single servings in a bowl in the microwave (I double these as they are pretty small). These brownies are not as gooey and flakey as a regular decadent type but they have more a thicker chewy-ness (like a crust but not hard or flaky) on the bottom and outside edges that some people prefer. For a nice treat, top these brownies with fat free Cool Whip and some sugar free chocolate syrup... diet brownie heaven. They sell this mix in my local supermarket and it's about $3-$5 depending on if there's a sale. These brownies are very sticky when cutting them so it's also good to make them in muffin tins instead of brownie pans.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies
"This bed is attractive, and apparently comfortable, since our picky dog loved it. But four washings into its short life, the stitching came out around the center section, dumping large amounts of stuffing into the dryer. We followed the care instructions and washed it only in commercial-sized washers without agitators and tumble dried it on low. It fell apart at our dry cleaner--we got tired of waiting the five hours the bed takes to dry on low at the laundromat, another big drawback of a bed without a removable cover. She repaired it for free (no small task), but we aren't allowed to bring it back.I guess it was nice while it lasted, but I expected that something claiming to be ""machine washable"" and ""made of the finest materials available"" would survive more than four trips through the wash. Between the purchase price, shipping, and the cost of washing the thing over its brief stay in our home (about $130 in total), I've learned my lesson. I'm never buying another bed that requires a commercial washer/dryer and that you wash the whole bed. The cost and trouble for something that fell apart quickly was ridiculous. Our dog's next bed will have a removable corner we can wash at home.",pet supplies,dogs,beds furniture
"Well OK, it is cheap in the way of being inexpensive, so you aren't being ripped off for much. But this is an awful product. It would be expensive if it cost a nickle. I'm sure the goal of the manufacturer was to make this thing absolutely as cheap as they could, with quality the last consideration. It is wafer thin, with no heft, and made out of hard plastic.Start an IV and have a blood tranfusion handy before you use this, since the teeth of this comb are like needles and will painfully scrape your scalp; you could lose a lot of blood. I finally used some fine sandpaper to round off the sharp points of the teeth, and that helped a lot.Just putting the comb in your pocket will bend the teeth so the comb becomes progressively less effective. I'm telling you, this thing is a cheap piece of trash. You don't want this.This is the comb you would have bought if you were living in Moscow in the '70's, a comb designed and built by Central Planning. With no competition there was no need to be concerned about quality. Kind of like the Trabant.

"Usually when a supplement company discontinues a product and creates a new one to take its place, you can be pretty sure that the new one is just going to be a watered down version of the old one. However, this is definitely not the case with Hydroxycut Hardcore Pro. For those of you who don't know, Muscletech recently discontinued a great product called Hydroxycut Hardcore X. In place of it, they came out with their ""Pro Series"". Being a big fan of the ""X Series"", I had some misgivings when I first purchased the Pro but I will say that i am impressed with this formula. They worked all the kinks out of it as well as increased the potency. I have never before had so much energy as I do with this new formula and without all the sleeplessness and ""jitters"" that are apparently so common with most other diet pills. According to the recommendations of several reviewers, I have been supplementing this with another supplement called 'Carb Stopper Extreme' that is supposed to boost the results of the Hydroxycut formula. My results with the two have been outstanding! I have been able to cut 15.3 pounds in just under two weeks and I feel fantastic.

Cats tend to avoid stagnant water so this fountain tends to give them assurance that the water is drinkable and thus they drink more than usual. Cats have a limited thirst mechanism and this device helps keep them hydrated. It is also advisable to feed cats wet food daily to keep them hydrated and improve their digestion.This unit has been working well for over a year.

"We bought this train for our 3 sons who LOVE the Polar Express story and movie. It came very nicely packaged in a box that it can be stored in every season. It also came with batteries, which is a huge plus! Setup and assembly was a breeze, and after a couple of days in the middle of the living room, we encircled the track around our Christmas tree.The engine and cars are large heavy plastic. For a G-Gauge train, the quality is exceptional. As the engine speeds or slows, the sound effects match. The conductor's call sounds exactly like the movie. It has a working headlight (that blinks when the batteries are running low), and an orange light in the ""firebox"" that serves as a power indicator.The only negative is that it will come off the track fairly easily if it is bumped, and it is a little tedious to set onto the track. However, an older child will be able to set it on the track and a younger child can operate it easily with the remote. I am glad we waited until our kids were older to get this. Our 3-year old can use the remote with supervision, but the 5 and 7 year old kids are capable of doing anything they need with it.Our family loves it, and if you remember it isn't exactly a ""toy"" -- more of a novelty -- I think yours will love it too!",toys games,hobbies,trains accessories

"Original comments as of Feb 2008While I loved the concept of this chair, I did not find it to be either space saving or very safe. As other reviewers have commented, the chair does not tuck under your table when not in use, so it really saves no space. More importantly, though, when strapped onto my regular dining chair, it is quite top heavy and I can see my baby easily tipping it over. The dining chair in the display photo has an A-frame, with the top of the legs closer together and the bottom of the legs farther apart. My dining chairs do not have that feature, instead having legs that are 90 degrees from the floor. I am returning this chair in order to get a full-sized one that is safer. I would not recommend this chair unless you have an appropriate dining chair with A-frame legs to which you can attach it. And don't expect to save space, although you may save a bit of money, since it costs half the price of a full-sized high chair.***Update as of Oct 2011 Um, I never returned it...May I just sheepishly say, we still have this chair. Can you believe it, after a review like that?? I am upgrading it from three stars to four, since the chair NEVER TIPPED over like I thought it might and it is so durable that it has lasted through two kids. My biggest complaint about it is that it does not slide under the table as a booster chair, which forces a toddler to have to continue to use the tray even though he has long outgrown that need and really just wants to sit at the table with the rest of us.

"My 3 month old baby loves this playmat! He lays under it several times a day and is always happy to hang out in the rainforest :) He will stare at those ""butterfly girls"" hanging from the center and just smile and coo at them. He also likes the monkey and the elephant rattle. The mirror is great, too, although I agree with another review that said it's at an awkward angle and needs held for the baby to see in it well, although my baby will look at other reflections in it and even grab at it to turn it himself. The lower hanging toys are at a perfect height for him to bat at while laying on his back. When on his belly, he likes to look at the scene on the mat, too. The music is catchy (everyone at my house can sing it LOL) and I appreciate the 2 levels of volume. The rainforest sounds are nice for a more quiet, soothing playtime. I like that there are multiple hanging hooks all around so you can move toys around and add your own additions. The bottom mat can go in the washing machine and dryer and comes out great.

I had gotten a perm and had my hair colored at the same time and well you know girls that is a very costly visit to the salon. I wanted to take care of both additions to my hair and was recommended by my colorist to purchase Redken. Her salon offered the product but being a wise buyer I declined her offer to purchase from her and went to the Amazon website and took care of business. I'm still using the product and it's been a while but the bottles are very big and should last a while. The promise to keep your color lasting longer has been kept and I love the way my hair is easy to comb after shampooing and condtitiong. I find that I only need a very small amount of condtioner and only need to leave it on for just a few seconds; well around 30 seconds then rinse. I have fine hair and leaving on longer would take out some of the body. I think this shampoo would be great for any hair to be honest. I remember one time on Oprah that they were saying that the shampoo isn't a big deal that most of them are alike and put your money into the conditioner. Well for me I think both are important and I would invest in a shampoo that doesn's strip your color or perm out of your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone and will be buying again.

"the true ceramic pro is the only straightener i will use. the straighten lasts forever!! it also curls hair really easily, you can have wavy hair with this flat iron, tight curly ringlets, and also loose curls. this is the most amazing straightener in the world. i bought my first one about six years ago and three years later is suckered out so i bought 2 more off of ebay because i wanted to have a spare in case the other one suckered out as well. the first one i got was off of the tv advertisement. i have really thin, frizzy, curly hair naturally. this straightener takes all the frizz out of my hair. usually my natural curls look really frizzy as well, so i go over and re-curl my hair with this straightener and the curls come out perfect every time!! i am now a 20 year old woman and i have been using this straightener since i was 14!! this straightener is the only one that would keep my hair straight thru the whole day long!! other straighteners would allow my hair to frizz up and start to curl about 3 hours into my day, but this straightener will keep my hair straight, even after a whole day after straightening, plus a full night of sleeping on it. i will never use another straightener!! i am a single mom so money is very important, i wouldn't spend the money on something cheap that won't last. i have not had to touch my third one yet (my spare) my second one is going on it's fourth year and still working like new!! definitely recommend this straightener!!",beauty,hair care,styling tools
"I bought this to treat a surgical scar over my right hip after a motorcycle accident. The incision was about 9-10"" long. About three months after it had closed it was still a bright, vermillion stripe on my you-know-what. After some initial experimentation with wear time and secondary fixation, I worked into a rhythm that's a little different from the manufacturer's directions. I cut the pad into four strips of equal width. I took two and applied them to the scar, overlapping in the middle. I then used three very large, flexible fabric band-aids to cover the ends, and one for the overlap in the middle. This was enough to hold the silicone in place for a week at a time. I realize that is vastly longer than the recommended wear time, but it works for me with no irritation. The silicone stays in place unless I'm really active, but I can easily mush it back into position. On Sunday mornings, I remove it, wash it, wash ME, then replace and apply new band aids. The first two strips lasted two months, and they look as if they could still be used even more. I'm on my second pair now. It's been a total of three months, and the scar is hard to even see - maybe a faint pink. It's really amazing. Anyone who's actually seen the original incision can't believe it.I'm not necessarily recommending that anyone make up their own usage instructions like I did. I'm just reporting that this worked for me, worked remarkably well, and that I made one $50 pad last for a full four months (assuming this lasts another month, which I have no reason to believe it won't.) Hopefully I'll never have to deal with a scar like this ever again, but if I do I will consider absolutely nothing else.",beauty,skin care,body

"I have two cats and foster at least one more at any given time. It can get quite busy in the litter boxes after their breakfast and dinner, so I've been looking for a second, bigger litterbox than the smallest of the two I currently have. I decided to try the Booda Dome, and if they hated it, well, fifteen bucks was worth a try. To my surprise, all three of the cats immediately took to it. They were climbing in and out of it before I had it assembled or put the litter in. As soon as I put it together and poured the litter in they immediately started scratching and using it. In fact when I went to clean out the two litter boxes today, I scooped ten times more clumps out of the Booda Dome than my regular open litter box.Pros:-Cats took to it immediately-Comes with a liner and filter, and the replacements are cheap-Filter helps with odor a LOT (as does the wheat litter I use)-Small round size lets it fit almost anywhere-The cats seem to enjoy the extra privacyCons:-My large cat (a long slender 12.5 pound tabby) has to stick his head out when he does his business (its rather adorable to see his little face, though, especially when he has his ""concentrating"" face on), so it is a wee bit small. My other two cats, the 7lb and 8lb kittens do absolutely fine with it and seem to prefer it over the other litter box.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"This is not a terribly expensive product and for the price, it works ok. It easily fit my Jeep Cherokee--no need for the extensions which was nice. However, it required modifications for it to stay in place. The screws which are supposed to hold the cross pieces in place do not tighten enough and my dog was able to push between the cross pieces and slide them apart! My husband used clamps to secure the cross pieces and they now work fine. The device could use some spring tension to tighten it between floor and ceiling as well because it can get knocked out of place (without even loosening).

Unlike heavier wooden shape-sorting cubes, it's light but sturdy, and its round shape encourages the child to spin it around to locate the various openings. The two handles are pulled to release the pieces and also are handy for carrying the ball around.Younger toddlers (15 months- 2 years) will need help with opening the ball and finding the correct openings, but they will quickly learn to associate the shapes with the correct openings. They will gradually learn to locate the openings by themselves and can learn the name of each shape.The Shape-O has some very easy shapes (circle, triangle) and also some trickier ones (pentagon, hexagon).",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters

"I'm a Scuba Instructor, Emergency First Response Instructor (CPR/First Aid), and my wife is a Internal Medicine doctor and ACLS instructor. I was looking for a decent first aid kit to keep in my truck for shore diving with friends. We keep a more extensive first aid kit with oxygen on our shop truck and boat, but I wanted something for my fun dives.This kit met most of my requirements for a little more than the basics, but wasn't going to break the bank or take up too much space. I specifically wanted a kit with an irrigation syringe, EMT shears and a CPR face shield. This kit was the smallest that met those requirements, and I was impressed with the other materials included.The pros:*good mix of bandages from simple band-aids, to butterflies and 4X4s.*decent mix of medications. Probably worth adding some additional units of the most common (aspirin/tylenol, decongestant, benadryl)*wraps, bandages, duct tape for immobilization/splints*well laid out package with clear labels for types of materials included in each sub-pouch*extra room in the kit for adding your own supplementsThe cons:***The included book is several years out of date and doesn't reflect the most recent changes to CPR guidelines. The three pages on dive injuries and pretty poor and even have some inaccuracies. Even some of the first aid guidelines have changed, and includes no mention of AEDs. While AEDs are not likely to be found in the wilderness, they are becoming widespread in general society.** The EMT shears are small and weak, not necessarily up to the task of cutting through 3 or 5mm wetsuits. Not sure if they would cut through tough denim either.General recommendations for additions (not specific to diving)-better EMT shears.-anti-diahreal tablets-extra aspirin/tylenol-extra decongestant-extra nitrile gloves-small pack of wetwipes-small bottle of hand sanitizer (unscented, highest percentage alcohol possible)If you want to use this for diving/beach:-small bottle of vinegar/acetic acid (for jellyfish sting)-seasickness pillsOverall, I still recommend this kit. The book was a disappointment, but as an EFR instructor, I wasn't relying on it to teach me much. Most of the equipment (except shears) are pretty good quality.

"This is a pretty simple solution to keep your bi-folding doors shut when your toddler tries to open them. Although there is a little part that comes in the package to add a buffer to accommodate the various thicknesses found on these types of doors, it's not perfect. My doors are exactly 1"" thick, and even with the largest buffer in place, the lock is still a little bit floppy. I don't open these doors on a regular basis, so it doesn't annoy me too much, but it would be nice to have a slightly higher quality product. In addition, if you have doors that aren't the same thickness throughout the whole door (mine is thinner in the center of each panel than on the ends) this might also pose a little issue when it comes to being too roomy, but it should still work. The extra room allowed between the lock and the door means that your child will be able to wiggle the door around quite a bit, which is often something in which they find fun and encourages them to pull and try harder to open the door.",baby products,safety,cabinet locks straps
"This was given to me as a gift. I began using it immediately with my newborn twins who were sharing a crib. They were mesmerized. I have since given away 3 as baby shower gifts. When my twins moved into separate cribs I set up the Rainforest soother in the other crib and they don't like it nearly as much - not as interesting, the button is smaller/much harder to reach/push at ~4-9 mos., it only plays for about 1/3 of the time as the Aquarium one, and the music is a little weird. I think it's the simplicity of this and the bubbles that they love. As an active duty soldier home alone with newborn twins while my husband was deployed, this soother was truly a blessing. At now 1 years old, they turn it on to soothe at night, turn it off when ready to go to sleep, and turn it on again in the morning to amuse themself while waiting for the other twin or me to wake up.

"I just stopped a medium intensity dog-on-dog attack at the dog park with a can of Direct Stop. I hit the re-advancing dog twice (Austrailian Shepard who had just been thrown 10 feet from the other dog). Both times he ran away once sprayed. I had a can of powerful pepper spray in my other pocket but it wasn't needed. If I had sprayed the pepper spray it would have hammered 8 fellow dog park patrons and their dogs...not a good thing to do if you want to maintain good relations with your fellow dog owners at the park. Immediately afterwards two dog owners came up to me to ask what it was, and both put an order in with me for two cans each (I am a personal security trainer and reseller of related weapons).As a side note, Pepper Spray is very effective against highly aggressive dog breeds such as Pit-bulls. I had the unfortunate need to spray a Pit-bull attacking my cattle-dog a few months ago. The Pit immediately stopped it's attack and ran around the entire school yard rubbing it's face in the grass. I'd suggest dog owners who walk their dog's frequently, especially urban dwellers, to carry a can of each with them. Of course, the Pepper Spray does double duty as a great personal protection weapon against two legged animals as well! I highly suggest the Fox Labs ""Five Point Three"" formula (Cone spray), which is the hottest chemical weapon spray on the market (I personally self-test all chemical weapons before I recommend them, and Fox Labs is by far the most disabling I've ever hit myself with over the last 20 years!)Be Safe out there!",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids
"My husband and I got the fydo collar for our long-haired chihuahua. The Fydo collar wouldn't have been our first choice, but our Chihuahua idolizes her big sister, a Terrier Mix who loves to swim. When our Chihuahua took to the water, the collar had to change. I found the Fydo collar by accident looking for the Gummipet collar (which our terrier wears). If it hadn't been on sale here at Amazon for and outrageously low price ($5 for the small solid pink one) we probably wouldn't have bought one.For the most part, we really like it. I'll break down our likes and dislikes for easy reading.PROS:1) Waterproof - gotta love that!2) Stylish and unusual - Dog collars for my girls are something that I spend far too much money on. I love waterproof collars (since they're both water dogs) but so many of them are so ugly. The Fydo collars (and the Gummipets collars) are both fairly stylish in terms of waterproof dog collars.3) ""No chew"" latch system - this one is also an AWESOME addition. Our chihuahua will chew on a 1cm length of spare collar until there's nothing left but a ragged edge. We do like that there are no ""chewable"" ends.4) Personalization - hubby and I have taken out the metal ""Fydo"" insert to make our own (more on this below in the CON section).CONS:1) The pink color seems to stain or dirty easily. Considering how much time our dogs spend in the water, I would think the collar would look less dirty. But it constantly looks like its got a thin layer of grunge on it, even when I wipe it off with baby wipes.2) FYDO metal insert - oy, vey, this was a design flaw. It's a little too heavy and falls out easily, but I do like the design of the collar, so I create my own inserts. For those Fydo owners who are frustrated by the hole left in the collar by the missing insert, I have taken to making my own. I found a background from the internet that matches the collar and seems appropriate (for my pup it was rainbow daisies), pasted that to Powerpoint and customized her name, our phone number, and other information in the space. I cut it out in the oval shape and laminate it (I have a laminator at home) and it looks great, its waterproof, its custom, and it costs me only pennies to make.3) Latch system - I really do like the collars system of ""no chew"" ends, but sometimes the latch can be incredibly difficult to undo if you need to remove the collar. I've found that if you undo the inside one first, the oustide one will be easier to unlatch.Overall, my husband and I are quite happy. I would love to buy her the transparent blue, but will wait for it to go on sale again.",pet supplies,dogs,collars
"After reading the reviews for this car I felt I should add mine. We've had this car for almost eight months and have really enjoyed it.This is a great beginner RC. I purchaced this car for my sons 4th birthday after an extensive online search. This car fit all of the basic needs for the starter RC I was looking for. I have been very pleased with this purchase.It has some definate pros and cons. The pros are that it is very durable. My experience is that the battery life was pretty good. A key factor, like many other toys, is turning it off when my son is done playing with it. It is also very durable as far as the rough play of little boy. My son loves the clown remote and easily uses the buttons. I love the fact that it fits into the top. We haven't lost it yet. It is a pretty easy car to manuver. Some cons are it is recommended for inside use only, which caused some frustrations at first. It also runs poorly on carpet and has no reverse.Overall this is a quality toy. If you are looking for a starter RC I would highly recommend this toy. My son still continues to play with it.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown

"This is a pretty good glue to use on completed puzzles. I bought it to cover a 500 piece puzzle. I applied one layer to the front and one layer to the back of the puzzle and half of the glue was gone. This glue does not come with a brush but rather a plastic comb. You have to pour the glue out onto the puzzle and use the plastic comb to spread the glue, which can get a bit messy.One problem that I ran into was that this glue was completely clear. Because of this, it was hard for me to tell which parts of the puzzle were and weren't covered. This was a problem on the picture side of the puzzle. One the back it was easy because the paper got wet and got darker. Since I poured out too much glue, I had to use the plastic comb to scoop up the excess glue and put it back in the container. I recently purchase a different type of glue from Walmart for only $2.50, which comes with a brush and is at first white, then after it hardens becomes clear.

"My 4 year old son has wanted this toy since the first time he saw it about 4 months ago. He was so excited when he saw it under the Christmas tree on Christmas morning. Unfortunately he only got to play with it for about 5 hours before the pedal stripped off. What a disappointing Christmas for my son. Evidently we are not the only ones that had this issue as they are selling the pedals on the Fisher Price website for $5. We placed the order as the only other option would be to pack it up and return it hoping that we can find one in stock at our local retailer. According to the FP website, it can take up to 72 hours before they even acknowledge our order. We are heading to Lowe's today to try and find a bolt that fits the pedal.We also ordered the Hot Wheels game on Nov 9th from Amazon thinking it would be here in time for Christmas. Another disappointment. We found out that it will not be available to ship until Feb 25th. What's up with that???? Did they not produce enough of the game??I also agree that the graphics could be better and all of the other learning systems we own do have options for ""levels"" of play. I can't believe that FP didn't think this through.Again, very disappointing.....I only wish the CEO of Fisher Price could have spent Christmas with us so he could have seen my son's face when the toy broke.

The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in.

After a week, we took him to the Doctor, and they told us to try one prescription... it got better for a while, then came back horribly.. we tried changing him many times a day because we thought it was just because we weren't changing him enough, and I think that actually made it worse.. little red raw rash blisters all over his bottom. We tried switching formulas and foods too, in the meantime... but back to the Dr, more prescriptions now. This time they don't help much at all, and then he started having allergic reactions elsewhere, on his back and his eye got puffy, so we rushed him back the doctor because we thought he was really sick, and one of the nurses suggested we switch diapers when she saw the cruisers... so we ran by walmart and got a few packs of cheap diapers to try, and viola! Diaper rash is almost completely gone after one day in white cloud diapers. We tried a couple more off brands and no irritation... then just to check we used one of the cruisers we had left, and Bam.

"This review is for the Coconut Hand and Body Lotion. The Shikai lotions are nice on the skin and they are thicker like a body butter or body creme. I also appreciate that they do not use parabens and the like. There IS a Coconut scent to this one but it is more of a soft Coconut/Vanilla scent. Very pleasing, however as there is no real coconut oil in the product that was dissapointing. (Could be do to the fact that coconut oil does not have a long shelf life and Shakai opts out of many of the more toxic preservatives.) They do have some great healing ingredients like wheat germ, avacado oil, shea butter and borage seed oil, however due to the fact that the lotion IS PURE WHITE and none of these listed ingredients in their more natural - AND MOST BENEFICIAL STATE - are white in color then it is obvious that they have heavily refined the ingredients leaving only a fraction of the botanical actives from many of these fabulous plants. Still has a nice aroma and leaves the skin soft for a couple of hours at least.(Will not last on supper dupper dry skin.

To make matters worse, you could totally see the metal arm moving inside the bag (there's about a half inch exposed... and the arms are misshapen so they snag up the bag when you move them) We ordered the Empire Magic Change Bag Trick with Zipper from Amazon and while it isn't much to look at (the handle is heavy duty cardboard, not wood like this set has)... it was only $7 and it works so much better! The rest of the tricks with the set are ok I guess, I'd say overall it was a disappointing purchase.",toys games,novelty gag toys,magic kits accessories

The device is good for what it does. It is priced right and we are happy with it. It has a few insignificant drawbacks in that it has to be anchored by a strap rather than a simple hole in the ground and the strap is annoying to have to step over.

"This product needs to be shipped in a heavier box and especially a heavier and weather proof bag for the gum. The current box comes crushed and the bag holding the gum is so thin it can't hold the product without tearing. Plus, on all three boxes I have ordered so far, the bag ends up sticking to the tape on the outside of the box because the box is too lightweight for the 25 lbs. of gum. If it is too hot the gum will be ruined and if it is too cold the gum will freeze and crack. This product was previously shipped in a weather proof bag. If this box is dropped there is a chance there will be 25 pounds of gum all over the ground.",grocery gourmet food,candy chocolate,gum

"Extremely disappointed with this toy. I found this toy to be very difficult to use. Initially, I thought my four year-old did not weigh enough to really &quot;stomp&quot; the spiders, but even after I tried to play (I weigh 150 pounds), I found that I rarely got a score for stomping the spiders. Also, the games are set up on a 30 second cycle. This is barely time for a youngster to start playing the game, let alone enough time to stomp a few spiders.I tried the game on a hard surface with very little improvement in its performance. My son really enjoys the &quot;Chuckie-Cheese&quot; version of this game with the rounded stompers and the pictures of spiders, but got extremely frustrated with the &quot;at-home&quot; version.I rated it 1 star for fun, since there isn't a rating below one. Two stars for educational since it would be if it worked and five stars for durability since we couldn't make a dent on the game itself.",toys games,games,unknown

"I am a 41 year old woman who has had acne on and off since I was 12. It seems I am always on the lookout for a new acne-fighting product. This product is nice in that it is not harsh on the skin. I have used this product for about a month, and my skin did not flake or get red because of it. I do have sensitive skin and usually start having problems w/ the dryness.However, I don't think the 1% salicylic acid is enough for me because I still got a few new zits. Personally I need a product in addition to the cleanser, calming toner and controlling lotion, I need an exfoliator. This is easily done w/ simple baking soda or granulated sugar, if I can remember to bring it into the shower with me. I would mix it with the cleanser, and it would probably be helpful.So if you are looking for an organic, gentle solution to your not seriously severe acne, I would say give this system a try. It is relatively inexpensive. If it does not do the trick, go visit your dermatologist for some advice.",beauty,skin care,face

"I have been using this habitually for almost 2 years. (And it's still the same tin) I am actually buying more because I toss old products after 2 years. I have used this balm on my lips, cheeks, lids, and even brows when I needed to tame them. It's just an all around useful balm, even for hair fly aways. It is an essential item due to its balmy, moisturizing, yet fast absorbing nature. The sheer color just works everywhere. You will be very happy with this product if you like a light, youthful glow on the cheeks and eyes. The tint is not as deep as Benefit or even Tarte cheek stains, which is why I find that I always return to this sheer version. I suppose if you have oily skin, using balm on your cheeks and eyes might not work so well. For me, I am normal to dry, so I just love how my skin glows with this balm. Not sticky, or shiny. I am also very pale in the winter, and find this strawberry color to be just the right shade. Cheek stains sometimes make me feel clownish, but not this one. Very excited to find it in more colors, so I will try them all, and report.

"I bought a box of this tea after I had to go back to work and my baby was refusing the few bottles of formula he had to take while I was away. I was pumping but was not getting enough milk, with my first child I had tried the fenugreek and it worked but this time around I didn't want to be having to take pills all day. I saw this at the Walmart while I was out one day I picked up a box and I want to say that within two days of drinking it three times a day I had more than enough milk. The taste does not bother me and I enjoy drinking tea if this is a hassle for you maybe the fenugreek is a better option. I plan to keep drinking it as long as I nurse that way I can keep baby exclusively on breast milk for a few more months.

It is intended for MODELERS aged 10 and up. It DOES require assembly (with glue) and painting.

"I've used Tan Towels for several years. They're easy to use, dry quickly so you can get dressed without waiting around. There is no ""rub-off"" onto clothing, other than MAYBE a tad but it will be gone once you launder. MUCH better than the creams, by a long shot...as far as rub-off, for one. I'm very fair but always order medium to dark, as this gives me just enough color to make it look natural. I like to get the smaller towels...the larger ones seem a waste b/c I can cover my whole body (I am size 2) with one, plus do my face. Sometimes I will wait til it dries and use another Towel or some of their lotion. I've used the TanTowels cream and spray, as well. Great to use in between or if you run out of TanTowels. The Tan Towels ""travel"" well..no messy bottles or tubes to take a chance on leaking in your luggage. Don't be afraid to order the medium to dark towels, even if you're not fair skinned like me because the color you get is not intense but enough for a nice, natural look. My ""hint"" to applying any tan potion on your face is, once applied, use a tissue or Q-tip to gently remove tan potion from nose folds and under your eyes (don't want to enhance any dark circles you may have). Also, if you use creams, gently wipe off knees and elbows which for some reason, tan darker. Using lotion on legs",beauty,skin care,sun

The concerns about too much pressure on the mandible can be taken care of by simply leaning backwards a bit so that the tension is shifted to the back of the head (occipital region).I will stick with the device but need to modify it by adding steel plates to the bracket enlarging its contact surface area with the door.

Couldn't finish eating the ice cream.Had my wife try it and she hated it. So I poured the remaining 95% of the contents down the drain and recycled the bottle.

"We bought 10 of these for my son's 5th birthday party as the ""goodie bag"" for each guest. As expected, we had a water battle royale to wind up the party. What wasn't expected was for three of the guns to break during reloading. In all three cases, the pump mechanism pulled off or split. We were able to jury-rig two of them to keep them operational, but it doesn't speak very highly for this toy's durability. On the positive side, the soakers were very easy for the kids to use, and held enough water to keep them busy squirting one another, rather than us constantly refilling.BTW, I noticed a review on this soaker (might have been a different color) that questioned why it takes batteries. Not sure what the reviewer was thinking of, but these soakers do not take batteries.",toys games,sports outdoor play,pools water fun

I don't feel like I spent my money on nothing anymore... especially since at the age she is at now theres not much she CAN do. I'm pleased with this one.

The tone of the music is soft to the ears, lights up colorfully, and the animal sounds are adorable.

I finally ended up hanging up on that call. Then I called a second coustomer service and got a nice gentleman in Coasta Rica who's english was good, I could hear him well, but all he wanted to do was refund my money.He did finally file a complaint/claim. Since this home theater was a ""B"" model and the last one at a good price I didn't want my money back I wanted the product and I needed it before Xmas as we had many guests.So, it might be a good idea to test/screen potential coustmer service employees for speed and volume when speaking before hiring them.Thank you",health personal care,health care,pain relievers

Mychelle's philosophy in a nutshell, for those unfamiliar, is that she doesn't want to put anything on her face that she would feel unsafe putting in her mouth. The company has done extensive studies on skin care ingredients, and the information is available on their website and other publications. Suffice it to say that Mychelle offers superior products using natural and beneficial ingredients. But the best part is that they work! I've tried a number of under-eye creams and gels, all supposedly superior products, but this is the one I've had the best luck with. My skin is not ""mature"" but I do tend to run on the dry side. As I said, I've been using it for 2 years now and am very impressed.

"We had been struggling with 3 cats to keep the litter boxes clean enough for their picky tastes. Even with two boxes cleaning twice a day wasn't enough, and it was a huge chore. We decided to give this box a try -- and let me tell you, it was the best $35 I've ever spent on my cats.This is basically a manual version of ""expensive fancy cat box which wont be named"" -- I'd rather save the money and turn it manually. It's quick and easy. It literally only takes 30 seconds to clean the litter box and then you're done. It's so easy, we can now clean it several times a day.... and the peeing on the floor problem has been *completely* solved. Completely.If you have picky cats, and don't like scooping litter boxes 3 times a day, this is a perfect solution.Make sure to leave your old box set up -- just don't clean it. Eventually your kitties will scope out the new box, and you can move the old one to the basement or get rid of it once you know your cat is using the new box.The only thing I could possibly complain about is I wish the ""large"" was actually a tad bit larger. Our biggest cat seems claustrophobic and tends to avoid this box, so we still have a regular box set up for him... but at least he's not picky! The picky kids are using the new box and loving it.Definitely very highly recommended! I posted the Amazon link to my Facebook and several people purchased and loved it as well.

"I'm very picky about clean water, so I choose a canister filter for my 29 gallon aquarium. The Eheim 2213 is excessive for my aquarium size, but my next purchase will be a 50 gallon tank.I choose a canister filter because they are constructed like a filter in a water treatment plant. The multi-stage filtration system produces crystal clean water. This filter is almost silent when primed - the first week I checked to see if it was running several times. I have the filter sitting below the aquarium on the back of the stand and have never had a water leak. If assembled correctly, this should never be a problem. Using Vasoline when connecting the hoses eases installation considerably.The direction were difficult to follow, but I entered `Eheim 2213' into (utube) and was able to quickly assemble the filter and tubing by following one of the video links. Once you understand how the filter should be assembled, within 20 minutes you should have the filter running in the aquarium.If properly primed, the filter will work almost silently. Any noises from the filter should indicate a priming failure and should be corrected immediately. A pump not properly primed will burn will burn out in short order.After three months with normal water changes, the water is still crystal clear. From now on, I will only purchase Eheim filters for my aquariums. It's money well spent in my opinion.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters

"My family loves this high chair. I have a very big two year old (37 lbs, 38 inches), and he still fits comfortably. I have it in white. The straps are a little difficult to clean, but the seat couldn't be easier to clean. It whipes well for simple messes, and comes of easily for more thorough washes in the washing machine. I love the reclining features, which especially came in handy when he was younger and would sometimes fall asleap in the chair. I also love that the chair adjusts up and down to so many levels, making in easy on Mom and Dad's back and safe for my son who now loves to climb in and out of his chair. The large tray makes it great for using the chair for so many activities such as arts and crafts and puzzles. And the tray is simple to put on and off with one hand. I also love that my son hasn't figured out how to take the tray off by himself yet, which he has with the chair at my parent's house. The chair is also very easy to fold up and take along on trips. And being on wheels makes it easy to move to any area of the house. My bigest complaint is that my parents had tried to purchase this chair several times, and each time there was a defect with the arms. The tray wouldn't go on right. I think it was probably a problem with shipping and handling or how the store was storing the boxes that bent the arms out of place. All in all, I have been very happy with this chair, and I am looking to get another one now that twins are on the way.",baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats

On medium it is a little louder but again, I can still hear my tv just fine. On the high setting it is loud, but again not unbearable, just turn up your tv a little, no you dont have to turn your tv all the way up either, it is equivalent to running a medium fan on high in the room.

"This stuff does not taste amazing. In fact, it tastes like watered down muscle milk, if you've ever had that brand. That being said, it does not have all the artificial sweeteners and strange ingredients muscle milk has. You want to avoid anything artificial. Things like sucralose, aspartame etc. aren't particularly good for the human body. Or, at least, their long-term effects haven't been studied enough to determine.The taste is bearable, and after drinking it for a while, I grew to like the taste. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just bland. Which is better than tasting bad. It is very low in sugar, which is good. It has 24g protein per serving. Whey protein is the best, and this is only $30 after taxes and shipping. Great deal. (I bought the 2lb chocolate kind). I refuse to try the vanilla as I have found that most vanilla protein shakes are disgusting.So in conclusion, this is all natural (which is great), cheap for the amount you get, has a decent taste (not great, but not bad. It's drinkable!), and as long as you're lifting hard, it will aid you in seeing results. I drink mine immediately after lifting, and sometimes before going to bed as your muscles are recuperating and rebuilding while you sleep.

"This is a great gate and Amazon has it at a terrific price... I believe I saw it in a national pet supply store for nearly double the price. It's well-made and although the instruction booklet looked a bit intimidating at first, it was easier to install than I thought it would be. First, I'm surprised by those reviews that say it is hard to operate. It is very simple. Really! I can easily open and close it with one hand -- simply lift up on the handle and it swings wide open. There is a red handle lock which you may need to use two hands to operate, but you don't have to lock it to keep it closed, the lock just makes it more secure. Second, the pet door is much larger than it looks in the picture. I have two 23/24 pound dogs and as soon as I set this up, I was worried that my dogs would be able to squeeze through the opening. I'm not sure if they'd make it all the way through but I didn't want to find out. So I took a wooden rod, painted it white, and duct taped it to the pet door. This prevents it from swinging in both directions and may not look professional, but it serves the purpose. If you have small or medium-size dogs, take note. Once I made this simple modification, it works as I would like and I'm glad I made the purchase.",pet supplies,dogs,doors

My husband suspect it's the Peruvian Balsam that was the cause. Certainly it's something in the butt paste because the allergic reaction (red rashes in blotches all over the body including parts that did not come into contact with the paste) would come on strong soon after the paste has been applied and then disappears as soon as we wash it off thoroughly.

"My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday, and it's been a big hit with her. She is a little scared of the train, but she loves the animals. We've been getting her more used to the train by putting the animals in and then sending it off down the hall. She runs after them to ""rescue"" the animals :-) Then she goes and gets the train so we can do it all again. It's a fun toy for increasing fine motor skills (pressing the buttons), sensory awareness (the animals have different textures on them and make sounds when their joints are moved) and visual perception if the child is trying to take animals out of the train or put them in as it is driving.",toys games,baby toddler toys,push pull toys
I purchased this about 3 years ago for the grandkids when they came to visit. Its now being played with by grandkids # 4 thru 6 and everyone of them have spent hours with this toy. Its durable--not even a scratch on it and even though a few of the blocks have been lost we just buy another set. It seems to interest kids of all ages although with the younger ones you have to make sure the blocks don't go in the mouth. I don't think I've bought another toy that entertains such a large age span and holds up so well. If you want something that will last a long time this is the toy to get--well worth the money you spend.,toys games,vehicles remote control,play vehicles

"The turbo twist spelling is a terrific educational tool, however, it is worth the extra $$ for the mind station. My first grader struggled with his weekly spelling tests.

For Christmas he received turbo twist spelling and the mind station which enabled us to download just his spelling words for the week. He has scored 100 on every exam since then and scored extra points for challenge words as well!!! I am amazed at what a difference this has made. We have all of his tests since Christmas on the fridge. Thank you!",toys games,action toy figures,figures
"Being partial to Sesame Street, I gave it a chance. However, it was not a keeper. The first thing it didn't like about it was the volume, when you switch from the three types of music (classical, rock, or jazz) the volume automatically resets to a very high level even it you just turned it down before switching over. The switch to switch over to another type of music is right in the middle with a very inviting slide switch, so it is frequently switched over. The volume control and tempo control are also right in the middle, but one solid color with -/+ symbols and were completely ignored or used at random. I had to keep running over to turn it down. The roller that produces drum effects is very cute, but the scratch pad is hard to turn because it's very flat. It has 6 songs and the sound quality is wonderful, but I wish it had more songs. The lit up keys during the songs are great. The keyboard is big, a little two big for a two year old to carry with ease. My biggest reason for not liking this was it's big selling point, the &quot;infared magic&quot;. It seems that young children are used to pressing things to get them to go, not &quot;waving their hand&quot; above the thing. Ernie, Elmo, and Cookie are big round circles that look like buttons, but they don't act like them, confusing the user. The child is looking for the cause that activated the music, but are unable to figure it out. The cause and effect of this toy is inappropriate for the targeted age level.",toys games,baby toddler toys,music sound

"It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems. We've used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did. It generally only smells when it's really full or you're emptying it out. I wouldn't say the smell is such a problem though. Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting. The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle. I didn't realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail! Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing. Over all, it's a good product. I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it's time to clean and empty it!",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

"I had previously been using my fan on my a/c to drown out the loud tv noise, nightly noise, that drifts from my neighbor's apartment. She watches tv about 20 hrs a day, so the tv does not turn off until about 3 am and then is back on again by 7 am. The walls are paper thin and the constant noise is annoying. I am planning to move in about six months, but needed something to hold me over in the interim. The fan on the a/c runs up the electric bill, not to mention it is too cold now to use the fan just to drown out the noise. I searched the 'net for sound machines and did not like the reviews I read on the digital scenic/nature sound type machines that loop.This works perfect for me, reminds me of the fan noise without the cold.

"I have a dog I adopted from Golden Retriever Rescue. He was known to have serious and constant allergies when I adopted him. I immediately put him on benadryl, which helped significantly. This was in Aug 2007. Over that winter, he did fine. When summer 2008 came, he needed not only an increase in his benadryl dose, but also monthly cortisone shots.This spring, I talked to my vet about this. She suggested putting him onto Clemastine Fumarate (Tavist) instead of benadryl. He has done fabulously well. His allergies always start getting bad as soon as it stops freezing over night, then get even worse as plants start blooming and summer is in full swing. Well, it's July 2009, and he still hasn't needed a cortisone shot. This is a huge benefit for his future health, since cortisone has significant long-term detrimental effects. And of course it's good for his short term quality of life because he's itch free!Furthermore, finding generic Clemastine Fumarate online has saved me a bundle.

"I received this gym as a shower gift and I am so thankful that we have it. We began putting my daughter under it when she was only a few weeks old and she enjoyed looking at all the dangling objects and the lights. Now she's 4 1/2 months old and this is by far her favorite toy. The only thing that I would change about it is to have a way to turn off the sound (but still have the lights work)--it's pretty loud and gets a little annoying. Most of the time I don't turn it on and she enjoys it anyways. Regardless, I still give this an easy 5 stars. It's a little pricey but worth every penny.",baby products,gear,baby gyms playmats

"Guayaki Mate Chocolatte is an absolutely wonderful blend! The tea is aromatic and has a mediumish body. The cocoa and spices are blended perfectly... neither overpowers one or another, yet both are prominent and easy to pick up on. The mate is more subtle, however, yet still present. Connoisseurs of mate tea, however, may find this to their disliking, due to how the mate itself is almost in the background.All-in-all, this mate blend is perfect for people new to mate teas, or for a connoisseur of mate who doesn't mind the subtle taste of the mate itself. In my opinion, this mate is best served the morning or as a dessert tea. I recommend serving the tea with no milk and with a teaspoon of sugar, as the sugar helps bring out the chocolate and adds a wonderful layer of complexity.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea

"I had to review this product after seeing how one person posted the pics of the crate being torn open by their puppy.First of all, I have the larger version of this crate and throughout all the years of owning and handling dogs, and all the various pens and crates, this one is one of my all time favorites!I bought mine for traveling to dog shows with my Dobe. It is way lighter than hauling around a wire pen and it folds down flat and easy to carry. I love the ventilation it offers and the ease of opening the top, etc.OBVIOUSLY...........this pen is NOT designed for any dog that is somewhat destructive...such as puppies...DUH! So for anyone dumb enough to assume so, then they deserve what they get! This pen also wouldn't be easy for a puppy in the sense that there is no easy way to clean it, such as a removable pan, etc. So if your puppy messed his pen you would have to crawl in there and clean it rather than pull the pan out. Another common sense thing you can foresee.I am rating this product with 5 stars. It is VERY well made. I do agree that the materials have an odor. I have had mine for years now, and it still has somewhat of an odor.I love the weight and ease of moving it and setting it up and down. I would highly recommend this product to any responsible *intelligent* dog owner.",pet supplies,dogs,houses

"I have friends who swear by the Gentle Leader as the best dog item they have ever purchased. For us, however, this collar was an incredibly frustrating experience.First of all, our Labradoodle flat-out despised this thing. It was a 15-minute process to put on with him hanging his mouth open and wrestling his head around to avoid it. With a lot of patience I learned to overcome that issue. Because he hated it so much, we left it on him for extended periods to try to get him used to it--but he never gave up trying to tear it off his face. While walking--I could see that if he would calm down and stop trying to wrestle his head back and forth it would really help our walks out as he pulls like crazy.Unfortunately, he never gave up trying to get this thing off. Eventually he figured out how to use his tiny thumb claw to rip the top part off his face (and I had it very snug) and in seconds after his success (before I could do anything about it) he had chewed apart the cheap plastic adjuster--finishing the collar off. Dog One--Me Zero.If you have a laid-back docile dog this might work great--but if you have a laid back docile dog he may not be a puller on walks in the first place. If they had made that clip out of metal rather than plastic I still would have given the item 4 stars just because it obviously works for some people. But to use plastic for that piece is just cheap.",pet supplies,dogs,collars

It was so EASY and CLEAN! The only small thing I noticed is that it is pretty big so you have to have room to roll it. Also the things that keep the lid on dont stick very well if it gets litter in- we solved this by drilling holes and zip tying it closed. Such a simple design but works like a dream!

"First let me say that I am by no means a protein powder connoisseur, in fact, this is the first protein powder I have ever purchased. I simply wanted to add a little extra protein into my diet after I started lifting weights.The first time I tried it, I used 1 scoop of powder and added it to 1 cup of skim milk. On my way home from the gym I literally choked it down, it was so sweet (and weird tasting; although I am sure all protein powders taste this way). I then decided I would try to make it a little less sweet tasting by adding some instant coffee. My concoction is 1 scoop of the chocolate protein powder, 1 level tsp instant coffee granules, 1 cup milk. This makes it so much better, dare I say good.As far as people complaining about mixing, I use a battery powered milk frother to mix it, only takes about 30 seconds to mix without any clumps in sight.That being said - I give it 2 stars instead of 3 because I cannot even begin to imagine how sweet it would be if you followed the directions of 2 scoops to 3/4 cup liquid.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements

"My husband joked a couple months ago that he wanted to get an ant farm, specifically a Facinations Antworks blue one he saw in a catalogue. When Christmas came I got him this one instead, it's the same color but came with LED lights underneath, which I knew he would like. Using the order form that came with the farm, I also got him ants from antsalive, getting the ""ants just before Christmas"" ants. (You can get ""ants after Christmas"" or ""ants right now"", too.) Ordering online was easy. The ants arrived 3 days before Christmas, all of them alive. I suspect that if they'd arrived a day later, they might not have made it because the weather turned very cold.The assembly was easy as was poking holes in the gel. The ants were great, but note they are larger harvester ants, about 1 to 1.25 cm long, all female, so if larger ants creep you out you may not like this so much. They were easy to pop into the farm by putting the ants and the tube they came in into the fridge for about 3 minutes. They slow down and you can just dump them into the farm without any escaping.The ants started tunneling after about 12 hours in the farm, and they made at least 12 tunnels, all interlinking. It only took them about 10 days to tunnel, since then they've been exploring and huddling together in the little room they made at the bottom. The lid fits really well and we haven't had any trouble keeping it on. The only difficulty is opening the lid to give them air. They are FAST and will zip right out of there when you open the lid. My husband solved this by using an old aquarium pump and GENTLY pumping in a little air through one of the air holes on either side of the lid. We also give them light with a low-watt reading lamp, making sure the temp doesn't get over about 77F. So far they've all survived almost 20 days, and the booklet said they could survive up to 3 months.I love this gift, it was by far my husband's favorite, too. We'll be getting more ants and another farm in the spring.",toys games,learning education,habitats

"We started potty training our 2 year old son with a small stand alone Baby Bjorn potty. He did well on that, but it was a hassle to keep clean, and it started to get a little small for him. We bought this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer for him to transition to the big potty. It has worked extremely well. He did not mind trying the big potty, and the ""cup"" section does a good job of keeping the urine in the potty. It sits very securely on both a round and an elongated toilet seat with the simple adjustment.We bought a cheap foam type cartoon character trainer seat for the bathroom upstairs, and in comparison, the Baby Bjorn is well worth the extra money. The foam seat had a cheap snap-on urine cup for boys that he was continually catching himself on. I ended up just taking it off and teaching him how to aim, but a lot of urine ended up in the empty slot for the cup and underneath in all the crevices and screws. The Baby Bjorn's design is so much simpler and easy to clean. My son will now run to the other bathroom to fetch the Baby Bjorn seat to use instead.

The leash attaches to the front, so a sudden lunge will pull him around right quick, often flipping him over. A heavier dog might not be as resilient to this as my 40-lb pup.It doesn't fit quite as the instructions intend, since it creeps up over his shoulderblades instead of sitting behind them, but it does the job anyway. And it might not be ideal for shorter dogs, as the lower attachment point does result in more leg tangles.

Without a utility room in which to put the catbox, the cats now share the bathroom with people.This high-backed, high-walled catbox is the answer to a prayer!

"I used Avent with my two older kids and was very excited when I heard they were coming out with a disposable system which worked with the bottles (the old system had color coded nipples that you had to match to the nurser or bottle and they weren't interchangeable.)The biggest selling points of this new system is that if you are already using avent bottles or were planning on it you can add these nursers without keeping two sets of nipples. Everything that you love about the Avent bottles holds true with the nursers. You can pump directly into them and that's a big plus.Here are the major drawbacks:1. The nurser base is very wide. I have small hands and found the nursers to be very cumbersome and they didn't feel natural to hold during feedings. The nursers are a lot wider than the bottles, if you've used the old version of the nursers you'll also notice how much larger this new design is. My husband who has much larger hands than me said that he liked the wider bottle and it didn't seems as easy to drop and felt more natural to him.2. You can't use other brands of liners. I pump & store my milk, and I've found that the bags are just TOO narrow to fit this bottle (Playtex & Lansinoh). You are either going to have to pump directly into this liner or you'll have to transfer milk (which for me defeated the whole point, since I use Lansinoh to store milk flat in the freezer!)3. This bottle won't take the Playtex Drop Ins either, they are MUCH smaller than the Avent brand. If you can't find the Avent liners easily in your area you'll be stuck ordering online.All in all, I think this is a good product if you are willing to deal with the issues I've stated. I used Avent with my older children and I SWEAR by their system however this product just wasn't for me. For all of the trouble I had with it, it just made more sense in my situation not to use them.For now I will keep using my Avent bottles. I might try the Playtex disposable system however I have learned that their system doesn't have as many silicone nipple options as Avent (Playtex currently makes",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"I purchased this to keep my cat from waking me up at 5:00 am wanting to be fed. It is somewhat difficult to program. The instructions weren't that helpful. Once it was program it works perfectly, however my cat soon learned how to put her pay up the dispenser and dig out a piece of food. At first I thought it was left over pieces that had not fallen into the tray, but after some investigating I discovered that she was able to move one of the teeth so that a piece would fall down. The cat would sit there for hours digging out food piece by piece. I tried several things to mess up the angle so she could no longer do this and still get food but was unsuccessful. Now I keep the dispenser locked in the pantry and allow her to go in when it's feeding time. This feeder does what it was designed to do, however it doesn't serve the purpose for which I bought it.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies

I bought this seat for my 3 year old hoping that he would get more freedom than he had in his older car seat. Well he got his freedom alright. I could not keep him in the seat. The harness system is entirley way too easy for children to figure out and he did figure it out in 1 day. I had the same problem just using the belt and tether straps. He kept undoing the seat belt.Another issue. When I actually did have him in the seat the straps are a major pain... They twist on a daily basis and are a pain to fix. I also was unable to get the straps tight enough.I think the only way you can recline this seat is if it is not in your car. I have a mini-van and a suv and could not recline the seats.The only plus about this seat was that it is a nice looking seat. Looks don't save lives though.I ended up buying a incredibly inexpensive low back booster and my child hasn't got out of it yet.,baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

The decal responded well to Testors decal setting solution, but I was still able to adjust the position after application.

"I don't think I can add a lot more information about the Avent Isis IQ Duo, than other already have mentioned in their reviews. However, I am one of the fortunate ones who first got to try out a Medela Pump in Style Original, but then bought the Avent... so here's my 2-cents worth:I LOVE the Avent breastpump and would NEVER go back to medela. Medela is not a bad product, but Avent just does a better job for me.I really like the cushions used for the Avent pump. It makes pumping feel so much more comfortable and 'softer'. I also like that I can choose my own speed, and therefore I am able to mimic my baby's sucking. I am able to express more breastmilk with the Avent, which will hopefully help to keep my milk supply up while I'm back at work.One downside is, as mentioned by another review, that assembly and disassembly of the Avent takes a little longer. The tubes are stiffer than the ones on the medela pump, which means that I have to detach the tubes before I can pack everything in the bag. The same counts for the power cord. So, at work, where I can't just leave the pump sitting there, I have to take it apart and put it back to gether after/before every use.However, what really counts for me is the endresult",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding

"We adopted two cats from a rescue shelter, a male first and then a female a couple of days later. They got along okay in the beginning but became more and more jealous of each other. The male had to be the boss of everything...food, toys and attention. The female started getting back at him about two months later by wetting in his favorite hang-out spots on the floor and then on my husband's leather recliner. I tried Nature's Miracle on the carpet first but it didn't work. The smell was still there and she went back and wet on the same spot.After researching online and reading the reviews and tips from other customers, I ordered a gallon of Urine Off For Cats through Amazon, as well as a blacklight from Walmart and a big marinade infuser syringe from Linens N Things. The blacklight found spots we were unaware of, including under the recliner. I took masking tape and marked the area about 6"" beyond each spot on the carpet and then marked spots about 4"" apart within each circle. I poured about 3 cups of Urine Off into a 4 cup measuring cup to make it easier to draw the solution into the syringe. Then I injected each spot with a full syringe of Urine Off, marking each spot with an X in pen on the masking tape as I went along so I knew where I had already injected. Eventually the tip on the syringe was bending so I found that it was easier to use a big skewer to poke the hole first and then push the syringe into the carpet. When I finished injecting, I then filled a pump sprayer with the solution and saturated the top of the carpet. I covered the spots with plastic garbage bags for 2 days and then allowed them to air dry.For the leather recliner I had to pull the leather covers away from the back of the cushions and spray the leather both inside and out and around the zippers. I injected the cushions with the syringe like I did the carpet and put them in garbage bags. I also put a plastic tarp under the chair and sprayed everywhere the urine may have gone on top and underneath of the chair including any padding and all of the metal and springs. Then I covered it all with plastic bags for 2 days before letting it air dry. Check the cushions to be sure mold doesn't start growing. I removed them from the plastic early. I used a leather conditioner afterwards to restore the pliability to the leather. The metal underneath began to rust in some places, but it came off with WD 40 when we treated the hinges afterwards.I wish I could say I only had to do all of this work once, but I had to repeat it a second time before all of the smell was gone to my sensitive nose. To be fair, the directions say it may take two or more treatments for the smell to be eliminated. Also, I had used the Nature's Miracle on the two small spots I was aware of first which may have made it harder for the Urine Off to work. I'm sure I didn't get down to the subfloor with the Nature's Miracle and I didn't cover it with plastic. In fact, I used a fan on it to dry it faster which I now know is the opposite of what you should do. But because the Urine Off directions said you had to saturate the carpet, the padding and the subfloor below the padding, and also to widen the area that you treat beyond the original spots, I had to buy a 2nd gallon. To repeat the process, I bought a 3rd gallon. But the end result is that we don't smell any urine odor. Only a slight lemony smell of the solution remains. I was able to save our $1800 recliner, but sadly, my husband insisted that our female cat go back to the rescue shelter. I'm sure she will be much better off as an only cat who is queen of her castle just as our boy enjoys being king.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking
"JR Liggett's bar shampoo is probably one of the best things that ever happened to my hair. For starters, it does not contain the harsh detergent Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which most conventional shampoos have. SLS strips the oils from your hair, leaving your hair damaged, and with an overproduction of oil to compensate. This overproduction makes you need to wash your hair constantly to keep the oil at a reasonable level. This shampoo does not have SLS in it, and I can go quite a while without washing it - usually my skin feels yucky long before my hair starts to feel gross in any way.Of course, my hair took about a week to get used to the sudden lack of SLS in my shampoo - which caused it to be very, very greasy for a few days to a week. I recommend that if you switch to JR Liggett's, you do it at a time that you will not have to go out very much (I did it during summer vacation from school). Do NOT let this adjustment period discourage you from using this fantastic product, though! It's SO worth it because it makes my hair really, really soft and thick, and my curls look nicer than when I used SLS based shampoos!Besides the SLS factor, JR liggett's is more environmentally friendly. It comes wrapped only in a small piece of paper, rather than a large plastic bottle. Also, you don't need conditioner because the oils in the shampoo bar do the job of conditioner (so, one less plastic bottle). It saves me a lot of money - even if $6 seems a bit much for a 3.5 ounce bar, you must take in to consideration the fact that you don't need to buy conditioner and that the bar lasts to between 6 months and a year! The scent it exudes is a mild herbal scent and in a pinch it can be used as a body soap as well. When I go on my church's mission trip each year, I use it as shampoo, and body soap, and shaving soap and it works just fine.I recommend that when you use it, you put it in your hair right when you get it wet, and leave it in until the very end of your shower (after you've soaped your body, shaved your legs, etc) to get the softest hair possible.To sum it up, JR Liggett's is a fantastic, environmentally responsible product with all-natural and safe ingredients, and I highly recommend it.",beauty,bath body,cleansers

The CD rom has lots of interactive lessons and even has a real game that you can play to help you learn. I would have paid twice as much as this game sells for....easily.

"Although I'm a fan of Motherlove products I was a bit skeptical that this would even work, but it really did! I became pregnant when my other daughter was 9 months and my milk supply dropped to less than 25% of what it was pre-pregnancy (I pump exclusively so I could really see the effects of the pregnancy). The More Milk Two brought my milk production back up to about 75% of what I was pumping pre-pregnancy. It tastes horrible and I found that I have to be strict about taking it on a regular schedule without drinking excess fluids around the time I take it, but it's worth it because it actually works. I had tried alfalfa supplements and raspberry leaf tea on their own and in combination, but they didn't really help. I guess I needed the concentrated version that is in the More Milk Two.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far.

I had more control over where the pill went and then I could quickly and gently hold his mouth shut and rub his neck and cheek bone area to help get the pill down.

"It's a little pricey compared to other lubes, but for a water based lubricant, you really can't go wrong with Maximus.Aside from the fact that it does a good job lubricating in almost every application, it is much thicker than most lubes, which is a great help for anal sex, and use with toys. Being thicker it tends to stay put, allowing you to concentrate on other things than constantly reapplying lube. It also stays slick for a long time, similar to silicone based lubes, but unlike silicone it doesn't stay on everything for ever.Because it's water based, clean up is very easy. It will rinse off with water, although I recommend using soap or a toy cleaner.I typically purcahse the larger pump bottle, but I grabbed this smaller size for taking to a party.The only con is I wish they sold it much larger sizes.",health personal care,sexual wellness,safer sex
"I don't order this to ingest it. I order it because it turns out to be the best deer repellant I've ever used. I have roses in my garden, a favorite snack for the numerous local deer on our island. I've tried a number of commercial deer repellant sprays; I was always disappointed. First, because they invariably clogged the sprayer, second, because the solution always washed off with the next thunderstorm, and third, the deer ate the roses anyway.I had bought this Cod Liver oil to ingest, but found the taste was just too fishy for my family's ""we prefer beef to fish"" tastebuds, so it sat in the fridge for a while. Having run out of the this-doesn't-work deer spray, and not wanting to waste the oil, I put two and two together and thought, ""Gee, if my tastebuds find this repelling, perhaps the deer will have the same reaction!"" They did.We mix the spray so the solution is about 1 part cod liver oil and 4 parts water. You need to shake it up quite a bit as you walk around spraying, to keep it emulsified. We tend to mix small batches at a time - a Spraymaster 32-ounce hand spray bottle works fine and lasts a while.The sprayers do not get clogged; you can get a fine mist; the rain doesn't wash it off; the roses don't mind it one bit, as long as you give them just a fine mist; and it also seems to discourage the bugs who also feast on the roses. Our roses have never been more lush.At first, I thought it was a pretty high price to pay for deer repellant, but when you do the math, and especially considering that this actually lasts and doesn't have to be resprayed as often, the cod liver oil comes out looking pretty good. I tend to spray only as new growth appears, so that the tastiest bits of the rose bush continue to be covered.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements
"My son got this set for Christmas a year ago. He plays with it constantly. There are so many ways to set the thing up, and inexpensive add-ons. There are multiple switches on the track and car paths, so if set in one position, one child can control the train and intersections. If you choose to set them to manual, then multiple kids can play with the set. My 9 year old daughter likes to be in charge of the car's intersections. They both play and enjoy this train set. We have the wooden set, we have the travel grey track set, and this is the one that they play with. The must haves are other motorized vehicles, costs at Walmart are less than $8. This is a great gift for any kid, from the age of 5 to at least 9. I enjoy it as well. The only negatives I have found is that if my son wants it to look like the box, he needs me to set it up. The plastic connections are tight, good for stability, bad when you put the wrong two together. Get a good large container because you will be adding to the set, even though it is complete as it is, and you will need the storage.",toys games,vehicles remote control,play trains railway sets

"I found this test kit easy to use and fairly simple. The kit tests for pH, high range pH (if you need it), Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. One complaint on earlier reviews was that the tests took too long. The most complicated test is for Nitrate, which requires a grand total of 6.5 minutes, of which 5 minutes are spent waiting for the results. So if you know how to set a timer, you spend very little time with the actual testing. I feel you get more accurate results than with the quick dip strips, and you probably get a lot more tests for your money. My biggest complaint is that the kit should include a pipette or dropper to transfer water from the tank to the little test tubes. If you dip them in the tank, you drip water and tend to make a mess. (Or maybe that's just me.) I bought a 5ml medicine dropper from the pharmacy for $2 and everything stays clean and dry.

"I have two of these for two locations; the first, after three years, works as well as ever, and I wanted to duplicate my experience with it. This older model is sometimes hard to find, but the satisfaction it gives made my search worthwhile. Here's what I like about it:1. The adjustable comb trims beard, mustache, goatee, etc., to any length its user might want. Removing the comb is easy and allows the user to give a precise and neat edge to mustache and sideburns.2. The vacuum is great. A few hairs might show up in the sink, but they pick up with one swipe of a damp tissue.3. The T770 holds its charge for two months or more with use 2-3 times a week. To recharge, plug in at night; use in the morning. Simple.I don't know how Norelco's newer models compare, but I doubt they could have improved anything but reassembly of comb and blade housing, since brushing the blade's rotors is advisable to do about once a month.

The only thing I don't like is the speaker is on the back of the puzzle, so if you set it on the carpeted floor or couch it's muffled (and you have to lay it almost flat otherwise the pieces will fall out). But the volume is real loud if you hold it upright and there's no volume control. But overall, it's a great toy and one of my son's favorites.

"My 9-month-old cat has been eating Evolution for most of his life now; I transitioned him shortly after I adopted him. He's doing extremely well; he eats Evolution every day and loves it. His coat is glossy and he has crazy kitten energy.I very recently rescued an adult cat, and I'm slowly transitioning her from conventional cat food to this. (When I first brought her home, she wouldn't eat for two days and was extremely skinny.) I also was taking care of a friend's cat for a week, and when I saw she wasn't eating her own food, I brought a baggie of the Evolution kibble, which she was interested in, and then ate.Most of all, I want my cats to eat this food because it's healthier for them; it doesn't contain the waste animals, beaks, hair, and ear tags that all pet foods (even premium) can contain--and is nutritionally complete, with the protein and amino acids they need. As a plus, it's a tasty food they like; when water is added--which it should be, to prevent dehydration--it's economical, too.It's a great deal all around!",pet supplies,cats,food

They're chewy with just the right amount of spicyness, and great as a snack for watching TV or movies -- a much healthier alternative to potato chips or buttered popcorn.

"After reading many reviews I decided to give this product a try with an open mind. So far I love the littermaid despite a few design flaws. First I would like to say what I like about it. It is nice not haveing to scoop poop every day. Twice a week I empty the container and in less then 2 minutes I am done. As suggested I am reusing the containers until they wear out. It also does keep odor down and the cats love to watch it work.I don't like that sometimes litter gets caught behind the teeth and it just runs and runs until you fix the problem, but I have also been able fix that by filling it with less litter. There is a gap between the collection tray and the litter tub that leads to litter getting on the carpet so I end up moving and vaccuuming under it at least onece a week.In conclusion the litter maid was worth the $90 I spent on it and does require less attention than a traditional litter box.

He then took the diaper off and smeared it everywhere. I've never had him do this with any other velcro closures. The velcro comes apart as I put on his pants and when he crawls across the floor without pants on over it, it catches on our carpet and comes off of him. Again...I haven't had a problem with any other diapers that have velcro closures. Also, this diaper is definitely not a one size diaper.

I maintained this heater as I was supposed to--kept it at the proper water level, etc. A week after opening it, the product began to randomly turn off altogether--i.e. leave the water ice cold--or heat up to the point of being painful to the touch. Two weeks after opening the product, it began to sizzle in the tank. For fear that my fish would be hurt or electrocuted, I removed it from the tank and unplugged it. Five minutes after placing it on the floor, it started to smell like burning. I picked the product up and found a huge burn hole in my floor where it had been. The bottom of the heater exploded off.

We got our son (3) a Geo Trax set for Christmas and our family and ""Santa"" also got additional pieces. We have a pretty good set up going and the tunnel is a great addition! I like the fact that it is motion activated. After you turn it on by pressing the button on the front, it turns on the light sensors and makes that water wheel spin and make train and nature noises (frogs, chirping, etc) when the train goes through. Because the tunnel sides are fabric, you can have them go on curves or different directions to suite your layout. You need a cross piece (not included) to go in the middle if you want to have a 4-way crossing. It would be nice if the crossing ""arms"" would go up and down automatically, but we just leave them up all the time so that the trains don't run into them.

"I hate to shave. I usually only shave twice a week because of the discomfort and extra time that came with using a razor and shaving cream.

I can shave in less than a minute and the quality of the shave is great and getting better as I get better at using the Braun and my face adjusts. I now shave everyday, weekends included.

Ten stars if I could give them because we were able to stop using the strong steroid cream for my 2 year old son that was prescribed by his doctor. Steroid creams have side effects that I did not want to subject my son to so I started researching other means of treatment. I ran across positive reviews here on Amazon for this cream and a mention of it in other reviews so I thought I would give it a try. It has worked like a charm and we use it every day to keep the eczema from returning.I signed up for the new subscription program as soon as it was offered by amazon because it is such a great deal and you can cancel at any time.

"If I wear the Cub at night when resting and to sleep I can put my foot on the floor in the morning with very little or no pain. Without the Cub I can barely walk for about ten minutes in the morning. The most important thing with this slipper is to put it on just right. To tight, and it bites into your foot (wearing a thick sock helps to prevent this). To loose, and there is to much flex in the ankle and the tendon in the bottom of the foot contracts and you get pain in the morning. I had to adjust mine to ten degrees because there is some flex that is inherent in this thing. The neoprene wrap does stretch a little and you can only make the Cub just so tight or rigid (that's why only four stars). If the plastic structure inside the neoprene that runs up the side of the leg wrapped around the back of the calf, this thing would probably be perfect. As far as comfort when sleeping, I find it a non issue. It is pretty comfortable. It has a solid foot bed so the straps don't squeeze the sides of your feet like the HealWell AFO Night Wrap does. I bought that one first and threw it away. You can't return these, they come sealed in plastic bags. Your can hobble (fixed ankle) around the house in it, but not outside. Just remember, this probably won't fix the problems your having, but will make them easier to deal with. If you have severe pain in the morning like I do, you'll try anything.

Basically when it comes to Auron collectibles, you don't have many options. There's this figure, the 1/6 scale Kotobukiya statue and...tiny bottle cap figures and keychains. That's about it.

"I have been using this hard floor cleaner for about 5 years and it has been my best friend as it relates to a cleaning tool. I have 2 levels (approx 2100 square feet) of hardwood and porcelain floors, so it would take me about 3 days to clean them with a standard mop or on my hands and knees (not to mention sore knees & back!). This equipment takes the guesswork out of everything and I can have my floors mopped in about an hour. The tank is large enough to do 1-2 rooms at a time thoroughly, and it sucks up probably 90% of the water so there isn't much drying time needed. The dirty water tank shows just how much dirt it sucks up and doesn't get re-deposited on the floor as it would with a standard mop (very reassuring since I have pets and a toddler). I have been using Murphy's oil soap and Lysol floor cleaner instead of the concentrated special cleaner sold by Hoover (since the stores have stopped carrying it) and this works just as well (and is cheaper in the long run) than the special solution. I've just now had to replace the clean water reservoir (5 years later, only after dropping it on my porcelain tile from counter height) - this goes to show how well made the product is (I use it at least weekly).

"I have PCOS & was looking for other options after reading medical literature made me think BCP and Provera were ineffective, dangerous options just hitting some of the symptoms. I knew I couldn't use birth control pills if married, as they can cause abortions (plus I would be blocking getting pregnant if taking them, then risking getting cysts if avoiding them when trying to conceive). Plus the pills made me--a normally content individual--moody and sad. I decided biodentical transdermal progesterone was my next route to try, per Dr. John Lee's works from Amazon. But long story short, I tried Vitex in the meantime, desperate to try and stop cysts somehow.The product arrived June 21. I took it whenever I remembered, aiming for 3x/day. My period arrived July 8th. Apparently ovulation tends to be about 10-14 days before menstruation. So if the supplement caused ovulation like it does in some women, it likely did such in about 3-7 days! Granted, the timing could be a fluke. Perhaps I produced another cyst. Perhaps I bled despite or because of PCOS. A five-week period, beginning in March, is what got the GYN suspecting PCOS in the first place. But it seems likely this supplement simply worked. My system has been messed up since my period started & for 7 years or more I've averaged about 1-2 periods a year. So to have gotten a period after mine ended in April, then birth control (the stopping of which can mess up ovulation/menstruation issues more than the initial problems) gave me one in May, is impressive. And it looks like this one, rather than being erratic and as heavy as normal, is gently tapering out to end in about a week's time.Currently I'm researching ways to be rather sure of ovulation in a PCOS'er. I plan to try various free/affordable methods to help confirm I'm really ovulating. If all looks good, I hope to be able to afford a transvaginal ultrasound in 6 months to confirm more certainly what's happening. The original ultrasound showed 8+ cysts in each ovary. Hopefully the next will show I'm cyst free (since cysts can, per John Lee, reabsorb into the body)!! Perhaps Vitex also helped clear up my (very slight) acne. Perhaps it's why I'm not moody and sad, unlike during recent periods I remember.Important side note",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

After using the Eddie Bauer car seat that came with my stroller this car seat is a 1000 times better. It's light weight which is great when taking the baby out. Also it's not huge and bulky so when we do go out to eat it doesn't take up too much room. Another great feature to me with only having a two door car without alot of space is it snaps into the base easily. I felt so bad for my baby when I was trying to get the old Eddie Bauer car seat into the car.,baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

"After what was supposed to be a medium brown dye job turned into black I went looking for something that might correct the unfortunate mistake. My friend suggested to me that I try the One n' Only ColorFix (which is also available at Sally's for about $13). It worked like a charm! It left my hair a medium auburn brown after one application. The ColorFix can be used up to 3 times safely and at my hair length (shoulder-length), one box would have provided those three applications. Best of all it didn't leave my hair dry or damaged at all! The only thing that prevented me from rating this product 5 stars is the smell. I joke that it smells like death but if you're looking for more clarification it smells a lot like sulfer or rotten eggs. That smell will resurface for the first several days that you wet your hair to shampoo it. However, the end result is worth it. Highly recommend.",beauty,tools accessories,hair coloring tools

First Response came up positive 3 days past my missed period, as you'd expect a pregnancy test to do! and I have no doubt if I'd used them the previous day or the day before, it would have shown me a + result then, too.To test whether it was just a matter of my hormone levels increasing, I then went back and tested again with a cheapo.

"I bought this for my 21 month old who is just starting to potty train. I thought this could be used either free standing with the bag attached or on top of a regular potty as a potty seat. I have seen another potty that looked just like this one where the feet flip out so you can use it over a regular potty, but you can't do that with this one. This one can only be used sitting on the floor with the bag attached. It is so short and flimsy and the seat is so thin that it looks terribly uncomfortable. My daughter doesn't seem to like it very much, but she will use it if she has no other choice. I also don't like the idea that you have to use it with a bag and absorbent pad attached. That seems so environmentally unfriendly and, if you buy the bags, you don't save much over using diapers. I'm glad this wasn't too expensive because I'll probably be buying a different one for travel purposes. The only positive thing I've found about this one is that it is very small, light, and portable. It will fit in my diaper bag or even a large purse so it is easy to carry around.",baby products,potty training,potties seats
"Let me first start with the fact that I have six cats. Three of them have long hair. The Cat Genie says it is recommended for up to three cats. It was very easy to get the cats switched from the conventional litter box to the Cat Genie, it worked just as the instructions said it would. There have been very few accidents, and these only happen when the unit gets plugged up. I like the Cat Genie a lot, but with as many cats as I have, I have to take more care of it than someone with fewer cats. At least once a week, it plugs up. When this happens, I have to disassemble the entire thing, this is not a hard task but it can be messy. About half the back ups are due to the permanent litter getting into the drain opening and stopping things up. The other half of the time, it is hair. The literature recommends brushing your cats frequently, and they mean it!I would make a couple of design changes if I were the manufacturer. I would put some kind of scraper at the top of the rim to scrape the permanent litter off the rim of the rotating bowl when it backs up behind the scoop. Or I would change the angle of the scoop so that the litter wouldn't back up to the top of the bowl rim. I would also put an abort button on the unit to stop the cleaning cycle when the unit gets plugged up. Too much of the permanent litter ends up in the inner workings of the Cat Genie, which contributes to the clogs. Most of the litter than ends up inside is stuck to the scoop and gets shaken off into the solid waste hopper. Perhaps a few more shakes before the solid stuff gets dropped into the hopper. It would be nice if I could set it up to clean more than four times a day. I frequently run manual cycles to keep up with the output of my six cats. Again, the Cat Genie is very clear in its literature that it is designed for up to three cats. I am pushing the envelope with six.I like the Cat Genie, but it needs a couple of tweaks. I am so happy not to have to clean a conventional litter box and deal with the litter and litter dust all over the house. No lingering smells either. I'm not sure how the cats feel about it, but they seem to want to use it and they are no longer afraid the the noise.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"My first order of alohaislandcoffee.com was the Light Roast 100% Kona pods. I had just bought the Bunn My Cafe machine. The coffee tasted bitter to me, not smooth like I'd hoped. I was ready to return the Bunn My Cafe and give up on pod coffee. I called Anita at Alohaisland and she talked with me and gave me great info on over-extraction, pod brewers, Kona, different roasts. She asked me to hold on the Bunn one more week and she would send me a sample pack with more pods so I could decide. She assured me that the Bunn My Cafe was not the reason I didnt like the Light Roast Kona. Anita was correct! After trying 4 more flavors(Choco Macadamia Nut, Dark Roast, Espresso, and Hazelnut)we loved them all! Finally we had the rich smooth coffee that we had hoped for. If you are not sure which flavor pods to order first, just call Alohaisland, talk with them and they will help you decide. I have loved Dunkin Donuts coffee for years, thinking it was a light roast. I learned that its a dark roast and thats why I didnt like the Light Roast Kona. I highly recommend the Chocolate Macadamia Nut pods!!!",grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee

Even if I did read this (which I may have and just glanced not considered because had kids talking to me while ordering) I wouldn't have expected what showed up. I bought 1 for me and 2 for a friend.The back scratcher is over 2 ft long and is really just enormous for a back scratcher. The wheels really aren't that functional and don't do much for you. You really can't get any leverage behind them to actually give a decent massage. The ones that showed up in my order had 3 wheels in a row in the actual handle, not at all what is pictured. I even passed over other back scratchers that were designed like the ones that showed up because I didn't like the design at all.The scratcher end of doesn't seem to work that great either. I'm not sure what exactly is off about it, but it just doesn't seem to scratch that great.Of course I think I'll probably give them to Goodwill or something because the shipping to get them back from Atlanta to Seattle will probably be as much as the scratchers themselves. I'm definitely not going to give the ones I got for my friend to her because there's no place that you could actually store this and have it be functional.

"This is NOT anywhere near as good as the Lite Brite I remember from childhood. Generally companies aim to improve thier products over time, but apparently Hasbro is only concerned with selling refill packs so that the poor child who gets stuck with this piece of junk can play with it more than 10 times. Gee, thanks. Now for an additional [...] my kid can enjoy his toy an additional 15 times. Real generous Hasbro. That's right -- the ""flat screen"" is really only black pieces of paper that you attach to the screen with the pegs, and once you've put a peg through the paper you cannot remove it without leaving a big, white hole. This leaves no room for error or change, something that was really frustrating for my son -- so much so that halfway through his first picture he asked if we could take it back to the store. Also, there's no ""On/Off"" switch. You turn it on by pressing a button, then 3 minutes later it turns off on it's own. How stupid is that? And the little compartment at the bottom that is used to store the pegs is IMPOSSIBLE to open. There is no way a child could get it open -- which could have been done on purpose, so that younger siblings don't get into and snack on the pegs -- but every time my husband or I manage to pry the thing open the pegs fly everywhere. Not cool. You'd think they could have come up with a better baby-proofing solution than that. I can't seem to find any of the classic style Lite Brites, so I may try to take the thing apart and paint the background black -- I figure I couldn't possibly make the thing more useless.

"This is a fantastic product. I have only used three different electric razors, this being the fourth. Bar none, the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor!! I do not understand the few bad reviews this product has received. It is very expensive and thus maybe some individuals are expecting some sort of shaving miracle. I don't know. However, if you are looking for a new electric razor, or ready to make the switch from traditional blades, this is the product you should buy. I have never had a shave as close as this product can achieve without some sort of irritation or bumps. There is zero irritation associated with this shaver. If you are frugal, but still pull the trigger on buying this, you do not have to use the clean and renew system every time. It is an option. You could opt to remove the foil and brush clean it, or hold it under running water. Bottom line--If you want a fantastic electric razor that shaves as close as a blade as possible without using a blade, this is the one to buy!!",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"First of all, I want to clear up a flaw in the description of this toy on Amazon. You don't get 16 different picture cards. What you get is 8 that are double sided. One side shows the picture with color for matching, and the other shows the same picture blank so kids can make it however they want. I'm fine with this, but I did think it was a little misleading.The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pictures aren't laminated or anything. They are just card stock, and they can get ripped while kids are putting them in the back of the board. My 4-year-old already ruined one of ours, and you can't buy replacements. Putting them in is sort of tricky, so I do it for my kids now so no more get ruined.I still think this is a wonderful toy though because it teaches color matching. It also gives kids a chance to use their imaginations and be creative, so it's a toy I would recommend.",toys games,building toys,stacking blocks

"Bought this mini staircase for my aging kitty who can't make the leap up to my high bed anymore, poor girl. I bought it because it looks sturdy and it can go flat for easy storing during the day (if I bother to put it away!) and also easy to take for travel if needed. It comes flat, and I had a little trouble getting it locked into the open position, but nothing too terrible. Definitely made me reconsider the idea of putting it away every morning, but then I'm the type of gal who rarely takes the time to make the bed; it's not like it's a 10 minute job, just required a little bit of effort. You have to attach the little pads on the steps yourself, but it was easy. Setup on the whole then not 100% perfect but very close.The first night I was greeted with the sounds of Baby Girl trying (unsuccessfully) to claw her way up to my bed. Unlike the two-step stepstool I'd had there before, she didn't immediately take to this. I dragged myself out of bed and got her, held her and kind of put her on the first step and moved her up to the second. She was not amused and squirmed away and fled the room. However, not much later she came back -- she's a Mama's Girl after all -- and did use the stairs. Since then she uses it regularly to get up to the bed. My other cat who doesn't need the assistance never uses them...although he did use the stepstool. So, there's something about this they clearly don't like as much, but I'm not sure what, could be anything. I suspect it may be the shallowness of the stairs.In any event, it serves its purpose, it doesn't take up too much room and if you're neater than me you could fold it and put it away (slide it under the bed, for example) when your pet doesn't need it. It isn't the sturdiest thing in the world, but perfectly adequate for my kitties (around 12.5 pounds I think...probably about the size of that dog in the product picture). And there's a bonus -- Baby Girl enjoys occasionally using the stair pads for scratching pads.",pet supplies,dogs,beds furniture

Not sure what deodorizers they put in the clay, but they're very potent. If odor control is your #1 priority (as it often is in small apartments, hence the name...) this is your litter.My cats also seem to have no complaints with this litter. The litter itself clumps well, comes in a nicely shaped container for easy pouring, and is not very dusty as the clay grains seem pretty solid.

My son tried to play with it, but of course it kept collapsing so it was down in the basement by the next day.

"The device is very feature-rich, small, and mostly easy to use. On the device itself, the only complaint I have so far is that you have to really push the buttons in very deeply. Not a major issue, but I could see how maybe a person without a lot of dexterity might find it a small challenge. The little case things get stored in is nicely designed. The package box was a little banged up when I removed it from the shipping box (not damage done in transit; it just looked like the box had been stored without much protection). But compared to the double-the-price for the same ""perfect box"" item at CVS, I was happy to get the banged-up box version.

"These two small wooden chairs are stylish and the wood finish is acceptable, but I could not recommend them to other Amazon customers. The assembly requires proper hole alignment in the seats as well as screws which can be properly torsioned into the holes completely. The hole placement was very bad for the rear seat screw holes on both chairs. I was able to redo the job myself using a drill press (if you have one, I recommend you sink the holes yourself first). I say this because the quality of the screws is so substandard that I would venture to guess that few of these chairs ever assembled actually have the requisite number of properly torsioned screws to make the chairs stable and likely to last. The pity is that such substandard screws (screw heads can break off or the inserts can be rounded) routinely found in similar materials made in Romania 20 years ago, now resurface with the same outcome. For a few cents more per screw, the vendor could offer screws that could be used to overcome the shoddy screw hole placement. Bottom line, if you find this kind of problem a nuisance to deal with, buy something else.",baby products,nursery,furniture
"I was pretty excited to receive this Hot Tools flat iron. I had used my ConAir one for about 2 years before I wanted something that had more heat and could straighten my hair even if it was slightly damp. Well, this flat iron did exactly that, for about 6 months. It left my hair shiny, straight, and ridiculously soft. I used it once every 2 days, for about 5 months (being that for a whole month I was out of the country) and now the thing won't even heat up. I leave it plugged in for 20 minutes and its still as cold as ice. Also, the on and off button keeps sliding so when you're using the straightener you'll find it goes cold sometimes because the switch has been turned off.

"My daughter got this house for her 3rd birthday. She loves it! She plays constantly with it! It comes with Dora, her mami and papi, a sofa, and this set came with Boots, Diego, and Swiper. We had bought her a set of characters as well too, so she has all the characters and we bought Dora's bedroom set. We also got the Dora talking pool set that goes outside the house. She loves to play with other characters and figures in the house as well and loves ringing the doorbell and hearing all the phrases. It really was a great gift for her. I agree with others' reviews though that the figures do not sit well on the furniture and it is mainly just for looks. Other dollhouse furniture I'm sure would work just as well in the house. The only other thing I didn't like was the added expense of all the separate pieces. Dollhouse ranges from $50-$60 (depending on where purchased - I know was cheaper around Christmas time), room furniture sets are about $10 each (with approx. 6 rooms), outdoor talking furniture sets are around $15 each (with approx. 3 sets), and figures are around $5 per sets with only a few pieces included (5 sets total including a Dora set). If you add this all up, it gets rather expensive for a dollhouse, furniture, and figures. Wish the house came with more furniture initially and not so much added expense to add on. But if your little one loves Dora like mine does, then this would be a great gift! My little one adores it!!",toys games,dolls accessories,dollhouses

"Heather L. Parisi has already posted the healthy benefits of Stevia, so I don't need to list those. I have tried every sweetener on the market - all of the artificial sweeteners of course, and then when I decided to stop all artificial sweeteners I began to try all of the products containing Stevia. I tried the powdered products as well as the liquid forms. None of them compare to Now Foods Stevia Glycerite. It has the most sweet taste and no alchohol taste. It does take a couple of weeks to get the formula correct as to how much to use per cup of coffee or glass of tea. I make a gallon of tea and put in two teaspoons, but we like out tea especially sweet. Stevial is very, very, strong so it does not take much to sweeten. There is no after taste because there is no alchohol.We use it in cereal, coffee, tea, muffin batter, cornbread batter, just about anything we would use suger in we use the stevia. It is very versatile. I have found that the results of cooking with this Stevia to be great. We have traveled with this and had no problems at all. A 2 ounce bottle of Now Foods Stevia Glycerite is about $7.00 at the local stores. Online I have been able to find the 8 ounce bottle for around $13.00 - $16.00. Even with the shipping cost those prices are a huge savings over the local prices. Most times I can get free shipping. I buy the small two ounce empty bottles with the dropper online for about $2.00 each and transfer the Stevia into them. Then I am able to take the small dropper bottles in my purse and keep one in the car. I have not found heat to damage the Stevia at all. You may want to keep your Stevia Glycerite in a plastic ziploc bag as sometimes the bottle will become a little sticky if you are not careful. One thing though, if you do start taking the Stevia and using it at restaurants and such be prepared for a lot of people to ask you just what it is that you are putting in your drinks! They are so curious about the little brown or blue bottles they just have to ask.TIP* Make sure you are ordering the NON-ALCHOHOL version. The alchohol gives the Stevia a totally different taste. We do not like the Stevia with Alchohol.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"I really debated before purchasing this litter box. I have always wanted a self-cleaning box, but have never purchased one, because they always seemed like as much (if not more) mess as the traditional ones. I researched this box, read reviews, and finally convinced myself that at least if I didn't like it, I could send it back at the company's expense, and they'd refund my money.But I still wasn't convinced. I was very concerned that my cats wouldn't like the different litter. So the first thing I did was to switch them to crystal litter. I figured if we changed their litter type first, then changed the box, we might do better.I will say, they did have a LITTLE trouble switching litter. What I ended up having to do was to put some ""slightly used"" scoopable litter (which is what they had been using) in with the crystals. It was like they didn't know what to do with the crystals until I put the scoopable litter in there with the smell of ""potty"" in it. After that, they figured it out and had no problems with it.I noticed right away with the crystals that they didn't track it nearly as much, and I was scooping poop by hand about every three days, and didn't notice any odor. So I was happy. After a couple of weeks, I dumped out the crystal/scoopable combination, and noticed a HORRIFIC smell in the bottom of the box. I have since seen that there is a crystal/scoopable combination on the market, and I don't think I would want to use that! Nasty!Anyway, after several weeks with the crystals, I gave in and bought this box. We are now on our third refill, and we have been very happy. We are changing the box every fourteen days on a schedule. We have not noticed any smell from the box, but we do put a little bit of baking soda in the base before adding the crystals. We have not encountered leaking problems. We do use the ""cover"" of the refill as the ""base"" while it's in the litter box, and I think that makes a difference.We did notice that there is MORE litter in the refill than there was in the kit that came with the box to begin with. If I had known that, I think I would have added some of the crystals to the first kit.The only problem my cats seem to have with this is that they don't love that they can't cover their poops with the crystals as well as they could with the scoopable. They tend to dig and dig and dig, and I finally have to tell them to leave it alone and the box would take care of it. I think they'll get over that eventually.Oh, and we also reset the counter when we change the refill... and they ""used"" the box about twice as many times with the first refill as they have since then. I think they were trying to figure out what was making it move. Seriously, every time the motor ran, they'd go back in it and look around like they were trying to figure out how it knew they'd been there. :o)One minor little thing I'd change... When the motor runs, the rake goes all the way across, then goes about halfway across before it ""flips"" forward. When it ""flips"", there's a pretty loud ""bump"" that can be a little annoying at times. It would be nice if there were some kind of bumper or something to soften that little blow. But again, that's minor.As regards the sound of the motor overall, we have Pergo and tile throughout our place. The litter box sits in the room next to mine with an open sliding door between. I do hear the motor, even if the TV is on, but it's not bothersome. However, I have noticed that if it runs during the night and I'm not dead asleep, I will be conscious of it... and for some reason, I swear it runs longer when I'm trying to sleep than it does during the day... ;o) Just kidding... but the point of this part is that the sound of the motor really isn't too bad, but you WILL hear it.Overall, we love the box and we're NOT sending it back!!!",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

I washed it off, reisnerted it, and slept soundly through the night.I am so excited that this is in my life now - I haven't had cramps, there's not ""period smell"" (gross, right?), and my bathroom trashcan will remain almost empty for a long time!Thank you, Diva Cup, for being so awesome!",health personal care,personal care,feminine care

"We've had the gate for about a year, set between our kitchen and the front foyer (near the stairs). No problems whatsoever. Assembly is easy and you can't beat the convenience of being hands-free. First Years clearly did its homework in finding the ideal functional solution - in one smooth motion, you can release the lock by stepping on the sturdy pedal and open the door by nudging your knee against a wide square on the center edge of the door. Closes and locks (everytime) with a somewhat forceful flick of your hand or foot. Makes carrying laundry, furniture, or a baby very easy. It is also extremely sturdy - we have not had to reposition it once in a year - though you will need a solid wall area on either side, as with most gates. Now that our oldest is 18 months, we have no worries about him hanging on it and, in case you have pets, our cat has no problem jumping over it. While we don't have it at the top of our stairs (no walls for support, just rails), I would totally trust it there if your house has walls to support it. Beyond that, the bars are wide enough (including near the door release) so your toddler won't hurt himself and there are absolutely no sharp edges. I know it's &quot;just a gate&quot;, but it is the last line of defense between your toddler and a bad accident. Because of that, you can trust this gate to be convenient for you, and safe for your toddler. Highly recommended.",baby products,safety,gates doorways
"I purchased this toy to help my 14-month old learn her colors and shapes, but this toy doesn't really do this. First off, because the shapes are made out of soft material, nothing is quite right - the circle isn't really round, the square has rounded edges, etc.More than that, though, this doesn't work at all as a sorting toy as the hole for the square is large enough that all the shapes fit through it. What good is a sorting toy that doesn't require the child to sort? And this is ignoring the top that is velcro'ed closed - it took my DD less than 5 minutes of playing with this toy to find that, and she only needed it as she wasn't convinced that she'd gotten all the toys out by reaching her hand into the hole for the square (she had).I gave this 2 stars as it is colorful and despite the fact that it's not teaching her anything, my DD seems to enjoy it.",toys games,baby toddler toys,stacking nesting toys

"Ok so i have been using Manic Panic for quite some time now and I must say I get the color I'm looking for. Of course its going to wash off in some time because its SEMI-PERMANENT!!!!, but its all worth it. It doesn't damage your hair so its perfect for those that choose not to bleach there hair and only want a nice highlight of the color. The results are awesome...IF you do it right. What I was taught before using Manic Panic was that its not like other hair dyes you would dye your hair with,it is strictly color and does NOT! stick to your hair it WILL! wash off, so what I like to do is keep the dye in my hair for 2 HOURS! and apply heat every half hour to increase intensity, because 20 to 30 minutes in your hair will do nothing. The longer you keep the dye in the more brighter your hair will be and most likely ( if bleached ) get the same color that is in the container you purchased. If you want to avoid your hair color fading so fast I use a Shampoo & Conditioner from Sally's called Riveting Reds ( because I have red dyed hair ), but they also have it for blondes,browns and I believe blacks as well. Its pretty pricey though, but if you choose to spend no money, You could also put some of your Manic Panic hair dye in any shampoo or conditioner you choose and wash your hair like normal leaving conditioner in for about 5 mins, not even just so the color in the conditioner will have a chance to soak into your hair .TIP",beauty,hair care,hair color

"I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.I hate this razor! I used to have a 5814XL that finally died. It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years. When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave. Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:1. Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.2. I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely. In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL. Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom. I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.3. The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.4. The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch. The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose. This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.5. The cord with its huge plug does not coil well. The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball. In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug. This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.6. Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body. This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a ""sexy"" shape. The shape is also a problem. The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back. Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back. That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.7. The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position. There is not enough friction to maintain that setting. It constantly wants to move toward the S position.8. The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems. The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough. Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver. Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out. As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up. However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening. It did not shave close even before the head popped off.9. Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry. As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly. That is really dumb!10. The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough. The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.11. The storage pouch that provided is hard to use. It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL. It works really well and I am pleased. Therefore, please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks.

This swing is awesome. Babies will love to see the mirror and the little figures that go around and around. The only problem is that lighter babies cause the motor in the swing to go way too fast.

"Nice design and very well-made. Glad to find anything made in the USA these days. However, I wouldn't recommend this for a Pug, which is the breed for which I purchased it. The strap that runs from the chest to the belly is too long for a Pug, but would be fine for a larger dog. I had to get the 14""-24"" size as Pugs are very broad-chested, but having the larger girth means having a longer chest strap. The rear loop that goes around the dog should be just an inch or so behind the front legs; on this one it's much further back. The causes the chest strap to ""bunch up"" when the dog sits, so having all that extra room means the dog gets his front feet through the neck loop quite often. I would definitely recommend this for a big dog, but not for a stout dog like a Pug.",pet supplies,dogs,collars

The second time I used it the color lasted longer, more like two weeks of a vibrant but natural looking red and then a gradual fade to a neutral red. I have naturally medium blonde hair. I wanted a more vibrant red, but it is really a very gorgeous color. I was reluctant to use it since I couldn't find any reviews on this color anywhere, but I'm glad I did. Seriously the compliments never end ;) I'm about to dye it for the third time hoping it will be even darker this time! Like most people say, the color does not look like it does on the box.

"I love to have meal bars in my purse because they are great when I don't have time to stop and eat a snack (and might otherwise reach for fast food). However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor. These Pure bars address this completely. Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients. If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing. The taste is also pretty decent. Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat. It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but it's definitely palatable and does taste like cherry and cashew. I also tried the blueberry flavor and preferred that one (even though I am not generally a blueberry fan), but it was a matter of personal preference.If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar. That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna). Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands. However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this. I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job.",grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars

"First of all let me state that I love my Aerogarden. HOwever, there were some issues with the herb kit. For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting. IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently. The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up. My purple basil and chives grew pathetically. In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems. Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill. Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed. This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced. Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics! In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon. I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon. But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes. So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants. Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00. I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits. Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual? Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too ""idiot proof.""

"With the cost of AA/DST's version of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D climbing higher and higher I wanted a big ship to go along with the rest of my Enterprise collection but I didn't really want to spend the kind of money and outrageous shipping fee for that particular model. I had this ship when I was a kid and I remembered there was nothing wrong with it, in fact I think it spent more time on a shelf being displayed than it was ever actually played with. The decals are cheap and horrible I would suggest Reprolabels, they have a kit for this particular ship and from what I understand they are quite a bit better than the factory offering, especially after 18 years of being applied, the used one I recently purchased is in quite nice shape and cost only a little more than what certain sellers are charging to ship the AA/DST 1701-D (you know who you are) although not really a deal breaker the decals are replaceable and the detailing work can be quite easily done with a ""super-fine"" tip paint pen as is illustrated in one of the customer photos. Yes exposed screw holes are present but they're small enough to not be noticeable at a distance of five feet or so and they're all on the bottom of the hull and pretty inconspicuous really. The nacelles are the only lights on and they are pretty dim although in the toys defense it is quite aged and the batteries I slapped in it were cobbled together out of a remote that's been telling me its batteries are dead for the last month but the sounds were pretty loud so I'm not sure if that's and issue or if the little light bulbs playmates used back in '92 were just this dinky. Sounds on it aren't as clear as what I'd like but oh well we have to consider the age this thing was made in. A time long before you could carry a 160gb media device in your pocket so I'm sure they weren't putting cutting edge sound bars in kids toys back then. She's molded in white plastic instead of the more correct grayish that AA/DST did with theirs but I can't be sure if that's paint on their ship or if that's just the color plastic they used. This playmates ship has the bar minimum of painted details, just the phaser banks and the little orange band behind the bussard collectors on the nacelles but it sill looks nice from a distance with all the decals and everything. The biggest complaint about this toy for me is that it has no stand whatsoever. I have two other Enterprise's both on stands in dynamic positions while this one is sitting on it's belly with a shot glass holding the saucer section up which is less impressive than this ship should be. Oh well I've seen home made stands for this toy before and they are pretty cheap and easy to make so if you get it you might look into that, theres also the option of suspending it from strings but that always seemed a bit childish to me but to each his/her own.Basically what I'm getting at here is this is a cheap and affordable representation of the starship Enterprise NCC-1701-D which if you're not wanting absolute TV quality detail then this would be the buy for you as they're durable and cheap used and you can still find them in pretty good condition. If you absolutely have to have the top quality AA/DST Enterprise D I would wait a while. They're taking orders for their second run of the ""All Good Things..."" Enterprise-D which should be available some time in March 2011 and will probably put the regular ""D"" back out shortly thereafter so you might just wait and find out but me, I'm quite happy with my little toy from the early '90s.",toys games,action toy figures,figures

"I don't review products unless I think they're really great or a waste of money. The Diaper Champ is a waste of your money. While not having to buy refills for it and being able to use trash or plastic shopping bags is convenient, that's the only pro of this pail. It's okay in the beginning when your baby is on breast milk/formula and not much else. But once they start eating and really pooping, not only do you deal with odors every time you change the bag, you deal with them EVERY time you add a diaper to the pail. When you pull the handle to dispose of the dirty diaper the scents of everything inside come floating out. My son's room constantly smelled of dirty diapers. I bought the Diaper Genie II when my son turned a year old and I'll never use anything else again. The refills hold a lot of diapers and there is NO ODOR EVER!",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

I buy mine directly from the company. 10 lb. box is currently around 66 or 68 bucks plus 12 for shipping. The egg white protein has a really nice flavor without the addition of any toxic crap like aspertame that you'd find in many whey products. It's super cheap and tastes awesome.

There are bands in the inside of the board so you can store each individual piece which is a nice feature and I like it. I also found that the board has problems closing.

"There is the same product on another amazon page, but I ordered this item through from the company listed here. It's so amazing! The ornament looks really realistic, which is exactly what I wanted. I didn't want some bridge or roman columns because let's be honest, those items just look put of place in a fish tank. Not to mention in fish's natural habitat, those things don't actually exist. I wanted to create a comfortable and familiar environment for my fish.The ornament resembles that of a rock or wood, but it is not heavy like either! There are 3 small plants that grow out of the wood, the long plant is EXTREMELY realistic and graceful, it sways in the water. The shorter one is a fuller plant, creating contrasts. Lastly the shorter one is delicate looking but does not compromise its quality.All in all for $3.50, and that's how much I paid in total, since I am an amazon prime member, it's a STEAL! The company also packs the ornament very well! In lots of bubble wraps and air packets, so it will arrive safely to your door.I rarely leave reviews, I think this is my second one on amazon, but this product deserves a two thumbs up!Thank you!",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,aquarium d cor

I think sometimes my daughter enjoys playing with the mice and birdies more than the doll!!! This is a great doll with lots of accessories for a reasonable price.

"Available only in the Fall and Winter, Mallomars are a seasonable favorite that fans snap up when they are on store shelves, often refrigerating or freezing them to snack on when they aren't available in stores. Mallomars consist of a round graham cracker, with marshmallow on top, and then covered in pure chocolate (the chocolate is the reason Nabisco gives for only selling Mallomars in the Fall and Winter - they claim the chocolate will melt on store shelves or in transport during the warmer months). Two cookies equal 120 calories.Although we don't go so far as stockpiling them, Mallomars are a favorite in my family. The combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker is perfect. Although the marshmallow is by far the most prominent taste, it is not overwhelming. The chocolate is delicious and the graham crackers are nice and soft. The cookies have a nice light taste, so they don't sit heavy in your stomach (they are round and about the size of a silver dollar but very satisfying). I also like the fact that they aren't loaded with calories or cholesterol (the saturated fat - serving size two cookies - is 15% Daily Value and the sodium is 2% Daily Value).Mallomars are a delicious seasonal treat.",grocery gourmet food,breads bakery,fresh baked cookies

It seems fairly well made for the price, the engine and cars are sturdy, the track is easy to assemble and the station is a cute decoration and everything worked well right out of the box.

Nice chocolate fix. If you eat many energy bars, you know that if the flavor includes the word ""brownie"" that its really not going to taste like a brownie, it will approximate the flavor as best as it can. Fortunately for Balance, their Almond Brownie flavor actually does pretty well in that regard. It is dense and fudge-like in its consistency with small almond chunks. You could let your mind wander for a minute and possibly think that you are eating a heavy brownie.The ingredients are not great, what with the sugar and artificial junk that's in it, but I don't eat them every day and neither should most people.

"I was so happy to find a booster tray with two trays in one. How many times has your baby eaten, made a disaster on the tray and on theirselves. Sometimes you don't have the energy to clean both baby and chair. The top tray is removable and can be cleaned later while the blue base tray is ready for the next meal!! Once they are both dirty just run them in the dishwasher.Another perk is that you can take the white tray, have your babies meal already prepared with the lid and store in the 'fridge.This booster is extremley portable (ex. grandma's, friends homes, restaurants).The boosters seat back even folds down so the chair it is attached to still can be pushed in all the way.

Coconut water is an excellent source of Potassium and if you've ever actually read what the recommended daily amount of potassium is you'll see that it is near impossible to reach on a daily basis. Vita Coco helps get there. I have tried a few other coconut water products, but this one has been my go to option.

"The most exciting thing about this game is when the bees fall out, not when you pull out a leaf and nothing happens. The point of the game is to keep the bees from falling out, but let's face it, all kids WANT the bees to fall out. It's fun to see bees tumbling out of a tree. So, from the get-go, this game has problems.Secondly, it's cheaply constructed. If you bump or accidentally shake it by pulling out a leaf, all the bees fall through. You're actually supposed to turn the base every time it's someone else's turn, but even if you so much as touch the base with your finger, it shakes it so that the bees come tumbling down. What would happen if you actually did turn the base? By the time it was the next kid's turn there'd be no bees left in the hive.Why not 1 star? It's a cute game. The kids (4 and 2) like to collect the bees and play with them outside of the game.",toys games,games,board games

It is easy to roll into other rooms and has convenient storage underneath. We are now expecting twins and purchased another co-sleeper so we would have one for each baby!

"This bed was relatively easy to put together once we realized that the directions needed to simply go in the trash, as they were absolutely no help. Also, the pre-cut holes for things were not even and it didn't fit together well without a lot of manuevering. As for the quality of the bed, I guess for [money] we got what we paid for. It is definately not as quality of a bed than some of the slightly more expensive models we looked at in other stores. The quality of the wood is not great, and the finish on the wood is horrible. There also seems to be plaster or something stuck to the wood in various areas and we cannot figure out how to remove it. It looks okay from a distance, but once you get right up to it looks to be of very poor quality. Once you get passed how it looks, though, the bed is very sturdy and I think it will last through both of our children. If you are on a budget and need a toddler bed right away, this is not a bad buy. If you can afford to pay more, or have time to save for a nicer bed, then do so.",baby products,nursery,furniture

"After a long internet search of hand held UV lights, I finally settled on the model UV-5G DeGERMinator from RestAssured. Although this model was more expensive than other models available, after reading scores of reviews (most were negative) on less expensive models I decided to purchase this unit. I am glad I did!The shipment arrived several days earlier than expected which is always a pleasant surprise. The light itself was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. The instructions for its use were very clear and to the point, and the most important parts were highlighted (by hand) with a hand written note on top to please read before use. Another nice personal touch was the handwritten 'thank you for your order' on the enclosed bill. That is something very rarely seen nowadays and was very appreciated. You are not dealing with a large, disconnected company here, folks. These personal touches were provided and signed by the founder and CEO of the company itself. I am sure I really can ""Rest Assured"" that if I ever experience any type of difficulty with this unit, Mr. Joseph Schulman will do his best to rectify the situation.The light itself is very easy to use and within minutes, my laptop, mouse, cell phone and TV remote control were sanitized. Having the option to insert batteries and 'cut the cord' is there, however, I have not done that yet. But having that option is great, something competing units did not all have.Remember one thing...the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" still holds true, and I feel that I now own the best light available in its class with a company that will stand behind it. (Just read reviews on other companies who refuse to even answer inquiries from their customers).

"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was a year old and she immediately took to it. She loved pressing the keys and looking at herself in the mirror. It's two years later and she still plays with it regularly. Now she likes turning the lights off and seeing the light bar around the mirror light up to the sound of the tunes. She also likes hearing the different musical instruments and singing to the tunes. It's held up very well. It doesn't look new, but it also doesn't look beat up either. Even though she knows all her shapes, she still likes pressing the keys and hearing how the shape's name is pronounced. Also, it shuts off by itself if not in use and the batteries last an extremely long time (I think I've only changed them once in two years).There might be two minuses, though they don't bother me in the least. If your child likes kissing his/her reflection, expect to clean the mirror regularly. Also, some people might think it might be a little loud, though compared to some toys, and in my opinion, the volume is not that bad at all.All in all, I would recommend this toy for parents of infants who want something durable and will keep their child's interest for years to come.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play

"I bought this when I adopted a 10-lb. pomeranian mix from the shelter to store his food. He only eats 1/2 cup a day, but I feed him really premium food, which is much more budget-friendly when bought in the biggest bag (of small breed kibble) they make. I was hoping by using this container, it would eventually pay for itself with the money I would save being able to keep a bigger bag of food fresh. One big bag (maybe 18 pounds?) theorteically would last him 3 months, but near the end (about 2 months in), he was less and less interested in his food--even so disinterested that he would sometimes not bother with his treat ball toys that I would put some of his food in for him to have a game to get his food. He still likes the brand of food I get because he gets so excited when I have a fresh batch, so I know his disinterest is not from boredom with the food (also, I change brands fairly often after the food is used up, with the same reaction near the end of 2 months). The food did not go bad in this container--it didn't smell bad--it just went stale, even very tightly sealed, so that it was less appetizing (and maybe less healthy since I don't know how well the nutrients fared over time).ANY food you buy, you should use within a month of opening it or it will go stale--even in a great container like this. So if you're using this container to store food, buy bags that are one month's worth of food each unless maybe you have a vacuum sealer to seal up whatever you have opened but won't use by the end of the month. (Freezing also helps.) But in that month, you can expect the food to be kept very fresh and protected in this container. I had no problem with ants, dogs, cats, or moisture getting into this container. They don't even bother with it. I just had to start buying my dog smaller bags of food--the size he could use in a month. I use this container for holding dog treats now, and I actually don't use any kind of special container now for the food because I got another, bigger dog and between the two of them, they eat one big bag (now about 27 lbs., which obviously won't fit in this size container) in about a month anyway. Maybe if I start having problems with staleness with my current method(I roll up the bags tight each time and use a bag clip), I'll get a BIG Vittles Vault--because overall it's a great product--but I won't get one sized any bigger than will hold a month's-worth of food for my dogs.Mine also came with a shallow, 1-cup food scoop that I still use. It would be better if it had markings in it that showed measurements--but if you regularly use a specific measurement less than 1 cup and don't trust yourself just eyeballing it, you can mark it yourself by measuring/pouring the proper amount of food into it with a real measuring cup and then marking a line at the top of the food.If anyone knows of a good, user-friendly, practical vacuum sealing food storage container, do let me know. I would think that would prolong food shelf life best.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies

"The Resident English Bulldog approves. She loves to go for a r-i-d-e (have to spell it out so she dosn't hear the ""word"") but it's always been a hastle in the car. Too much jumping around and unable to simmer down. Big distraction for the driver not to mention unsafe for a bull in a china shop (I mean bull in a Camry) to be tooling around town out of control. Scolding never worked. Those harness contraptions that loop over a seatbelt, no good. This Pet Kennel has changed everything. Pearl is comfortable and contained inside her mobile crate. Excellent air flow with lots of screen. The large model fits across the back seat of the car, leaving pleanty of room inside.The directions are vague, actually non-existant. I've found the retention straps hold the Kennel most solid when looped over the seat back. Looped over the seat belts it's too loose and shifts around the back seat too much. If your car has back seats that fold for access into the trunk it will be easy to install and remove. To hold it tight, you will need to run the strap up behind and over the top of the seat back. (This sounds worse than it is.)Oh yeah, almost forgot the best part. All the dog hair and associated slobber is contained and the inside of your car dosen't get trashed.Well made, well thought out.

"Of everything I registered for, this was the single most critical/useful item of them all. I was SO ENGORGED when they released me from the hospital after my son was born that all I could do was cry and leak milk. Thankfully, my Medela breast pump was waiting for me when I got home. I had tried a hand pump, which was useless and very discouraging. However, I had my Pump In Style up and running in no time, and I felt better immediately!! Not only did my breasts return to a normal size and texture, but my son was finally able to latch on and nurse, and boy was he HUNGRY! In the months that followed, I was able to return to work and continue to pump 2-3 times a day -- my son NEVER needed formula EVER. My best advice to you is -- buy this item BEFORE you give birth. People who tell you you won't need it until you return to work have obviously never dealt with engorgement issues. I have also heard of people successfully using a breast pump to help their milk ""come in"" if it is taking a long time and your baby is really fussy/hungry. Plus, pumping and storing allows dad to be able to feed the baby too, which is great for bonding for them and great for you when you just need to SLEEP (or read, or shop, or take a HOT BATH!). I am a HUGE FAN of this product, which was never painful, was easy to use and clean, extrememly reliable and transportabe and allowed me to be able to provide my baby with the very best food even when I was not around to nurse him.

The very next time I ate vanilla ice cream I used the 'other half' of the bottle. That's right, two doses and my butterscotch goodies were all gone. That brings me to my only complaint--1 dram is way too tiny,at $1.99 + $.99 for shipping and handling. The manufacturer should think about a larger quantity. I have therefore gone to another website and ordered a 2oz. bottle. Oh, yes, there is one other plus-- this is a flavoring and not a syrup.

"I have used my glider now for 6 months and cannot say how much I appreciate having it in my baby's room. I bought it sight unseen based on Amazon reviews and I am so glad I did. For around $300 it is as good, if not better, than many of the more expensive gliders I checked out at BRU and other baby stores. I am 5'4"" and my husband is 6'0"" and we both fit comfortably on the chair with our son. It glides smoothly with no noise, locks in place if you want it to and wipes down easily if you happen to get spit-up on it. I use a My Brest Friend and it *just* fits onto my lap and down between the armrests. Perhaps my only comment is that some people might find that too narrow. Personally, I did not mind that I have to shove the pillow down a bit - I think it actually makes it easier to feed when the pillow is like that.Final note - I was a bit nervous about the neutral color and the wood looking a bit odd on Amazon, but I think the color of the wood and the cushion color look better in person.

"The Hiss Card Game is colorful, easy to play, and beats Candyland if you are the adult playing it with a little one.Color matching, building the longest snake, and building the most snakes which you must then count are some of the ways we've tried to play this game with our grandson. At two years old, he isn't quite ready to sit still and play a game, but I am a firm believer that starting card and board games early-on is a good thing. In addition to honing thinking skills, game-playing teaches social skills, face-to-face interaction, and taking turns which are important skills for little ones to acquire. I also select games that are recommended for an age range that is a bit older than the child receiving the game. This encourages parents or older siblings to ""help"" the little one learn the game and to play it, too.Hiss is a game that you will enjoy playing. It is a game to play on the floor and one that everyone can have fun doing.",toys games,games,card games

"We love the Omega Paw litter boxes to death, but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box.Our cats don't like the paw cleaning side, they refused to walk on it. So we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter, but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor. We leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those, but our new boxes are doing fine without them. The cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves.

I use the curling iron 365 days a year, and am perfectly happy with it. However, the magic of this appliance really comes into play when traveling. So as not to have to travel with two appliances, this combo is PERFECT for the job.

"This product is fun, and it comes as advertised. It does, however, have one flaw--though it is one that we've been able to overcome. It comes with the ball, and a separate attachment to plug it up, AND a separate attachment that you need to attach to a standard air pump to blow it up. Anyone with kids knows that trying to keep track of small separate attachments with a toy that you are bringing places can be tough/impossible.So, as expected, we lost the attachment needed to blow it up. However, this turned out to be not as big of a deal as we had feared. The ball is not that big. And it is possible to just blow it up by mouth and then seal it up. So, if you are willing/able to do that (not that hard), then you don't need the separate blowing-up attachment.Finally, I would say that if you have a kid with a real problem with swallowing things, that the plug-it-up attachment might possibly come off and be a bit of a choking hazard. It has not happened with us, and we are not worried about it, but it is theoretically possible.All that said, I still give it four stars because it is very durable and both our kids (4yr old and 1.5 yr old) really really like it.

"Being in my late 40's, I have a drug store shelf of lotions and potions for that ""magic fix"" in my bathroom closet. I keep this one along with a couple of others favorites in a basket next to my coach that I apply every evening if not more. I have used it almost since it first came out. It does firm, just use daily and you will see. My (female) boss who just turned 40 recently commented on how amazed she is I have absolutly no lines what so ever around my eyes. (Especially since I smoke). I have been using various eye creams since I was in my 20's. This is a good one indeed. The firming qualities of it does sometimes make it feel a bit ""dry"" because it is actually tightening. If you are younger and perhaps don't need a tightening agent yet, try a true just moisturizer with out tightening agents. I often use Garnier Nutritionist Regenerating Eye Moisturizer. It makes the under eye feel softer. I try many things and often buy what I find on sale at the drug store. I always stock up on these 2 if on sale.

"My Pointer/Great Dane mix had a Lupine Pet collar when we first got him, but he grew out of it. After that, we got him a Kong collar with reflective stitching (which is the reason we chose it). He's been wearing it for about half a year and it help up fine, but it was problematic because when tugging on the collar with our hands or a leash, it would loosen and become too big. I was afraid he'd be able to slip out of it if he pulled hard enough. I chose this collar because (1) it has a lifetime warranty and he's a chewer, (2) I liked his previous Lupine Pet collar, and (3) it's made in the USA. I bought it at a local store because I wanted to promote local business, so it was a little more expensive than it is here. The material is nice and thick. It fits perfectly. And, it doesn't slide like the Kong collar did! I'm very happy.

For the price I was actually not expecting anything good. We were just hoping for it to be good enough to stop the baby from climbing up the stairs. I was positively surprised at how good it actually works. It surely is not pretty but it does what it's supposed to do for a low price.The only thing difficult is getting it set up for the first time. I had to use one foot to keep it pushed against the wall while pulling with both hands to spread it between the walls in the stairwell. Definitely nothing you could do with a baby in your arms.But once it's set up it is easy to operate with only one hand. The memory funktion keeps it in the same position and the gate doesn't have to be readjusted each time.I also love how good it stays in place. No matter how hard my son is pulling and pushing on it - IT DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL. Definitely safe and easy to use at a top price.

That cover featured Fury in a pose much like this figure in both costume and weapon, sans rocket pack. Wonderfully articulated and beautifully sculpted. This figure really looks like the Steranko Fury. Kudos to Toy Biz and Marvel for giving a more minor character a chance to shine.",toys games,action toy figures,figures
This was a birthday gift for my 5 year old great nephew. He is having a great time playing with it. There was some frustration the first few days because everyone was too tired from the party to read the directions. LolThis set is 3 pieces short for building the TRex. It has enough to build the other dinosaur. If I had known that I would have bought what was needed for the TRex.Everyone is having fun building things with it.

"""It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" has been a part of my Halloween for as long as I can remember. I still pop in the DVD when crafting my yearly Jack-o-Lantern, wondering who exactly keeps a store of rocks to toss in Charlie Brown's bag.Playing Mantis, with this second collection, has again made the Peanuts gang leap from the screen and into my house. Lucy is here, in her standout Witch outfit, complete with pointy hat and green mask. Schroeder with Grand Piano and Haunted Candelabra, and of course Snoopy, the WWI flying ace sneaking across the French countryside. They all come with nice bases for the figures to stand on, and look great together with Set A.If you are someone who like to decorate for Halloween, then you can't go wrong with this figure set.

"This doesn't give as much color as I was expecting. There was definately a hint of a change, but it wasn't like actual hair COLOR. It is also a VERY MESSY product, and there is just no way not to make a huge mess while using it. I actually decided to use it OUTSIDE in order not to make such a mess in my bathroom! It is also REALLY HARD to rinse out--it takes FOREVER. It also leaves your hair with no shine and feeling like straw. You almost HAVE to use some sort of conditioner to get the rest of the stuff out and to give your hair a little softness and shine. I had some conditioner left over from traditional hair color and I used that. If the color had been really good, I would be willing to put up with all that, but it just wasn't. I tried two different colors and neither one gave very strong color after leaving it on for an hour. It might work better on lighter hair colors--mine is a medium brown. There IS, however, a LOT of product for the money. You could use this on long hair in two applications, easily, and more for short hair. So if you are looking for subtle, safe, natural color, this might be your thing. Just use a conditioner!",beauty,hair care,hair color

"As a standalone toy, the Coastal Winds Airport is alright. Its neat that the tower offers multiple vehicle sounds. Its also interesting that the 'flying arm' is modular and appears to be ready to support additional planes and helicopters beyond the original.The thing is, it doesn't really integrate with the rest of the Geotrax system. The road vehicles and the train vehicles can connect to one another and even drive on each other's tracks. The airport really doesn't have any way of connecting to the rest of the layout and just sort of 'sits next to' the rest of your Geotrax setup.

My wife and I are HUGE friends fans. For us the game was very fun. We got together with some other Friends fans and played. The one problem with the game is it appears to have been put together without much thought. The only thing that is actually fun is the questions.The game comes in a nice tin that makes you think the game is very high quality. This is not true. Some of the questions are printed upside down. Most of them are numbered (some are not). This did not seem to bother any of the other players besides me. I think that if you pay this money on a game you might as well proofread it. As I said earlier the questions are very fun and actually worth the price alone to a true fan. I have seen every episode and the questions are a good mix of difficulty.Since this is the only Friends game out there I just think they could have spent a little more time for it and made it a good collectible if not a good game.,toys games,games,board games

"We really do not like this sling, which is a shame b/c I was really excited about it b/c it looks so easy to use. The biggest drawback of this sling is that it's not adjustable - even if you get it sized correctly for your body, you have to take into account that babies are all different sizes too. Based on his age and the Hotsling's documentation, my baby should be comfortable in a forward or inward facing front carry. The sling is too small to carry him facing forward and too big for him to face me and stay upright. He never could lay down in it either b/c he's much too long - he was 26"" long at 3mos old. Save your money and get a sling that adjusts to fit you AND your baby. I have a ring sling from another manufacturer that is much more comfortable for both of us.

Having 2 placed in the center of the filter means it rocks back and forth and is not secure. Second, the bracket you can use in place of the top suction cup doesn't fit on the lip of my tank. So again, it keeps falling into the tank. If I can't return it because it's been used I may actually just throw it away. If you're looking for a good internal filter check out Ovation or Fluval. Don't waste your money on this one.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters

"After reading so many favorable reviews I was convinced that I would at least be pleased, the only question being degree. Not so. Maybe I should have been suspicious when the listing said ""Only one bag left"" as I was ordering. But hey, that can mean they only roast 2 bags at a time, right? In this case, I think maybe not. As soon as I opened the bag, I feared the worst- no burst of that heavenly aroma, in fact more like opening a bag of ground coffee from the grocery store. That's pretty much the way the results worked out. I was using it French press, not espresso. Totally lifeless unless you power up to to where the bitterness becomes a factor, then it does finally get some flavor- though certainly nothing special, and still no aroma.All in all, most any grocery store house brand is its equal in flavor. Possibly its price gives the edge if that is all you are after. I suppose you get what you pay for but I would take some of the warehouse brands (one in particular) over this any day, on both counts. The package has no consumer decipherable date or freshness information- perhaps wisely so.

I have permacold feet due to chemotherapy, but hand warmers placed between layers of socks are far more comfortable than this. It was also a little annoying to find that I had indeed ordered a ""foot"" warmer, and not ""feet"" warmers. For that price, I kind of expected there would be two.

"Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the ""single malt and cigars"" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea

So, I decided to check out the Braun epilator and all I can say is, ""Where have you been all my life????!!!!"" Did it hurt? Not if the hair was very short and I can't believe how it still removes super short hair! The trick is to do it on clean, dry skin. Also, do it in a circular motion since most hair (at least mine) grows in differently. Don't use it on the face (trust me, I tried and ended up buying a smaller one meant for more sensitive areas). Also, make sure your bikini area is very short and that you have no moisturizer or deodorant on when you do the underarm. Seriously, it doesn't hurt that much... waxing is a killer but epilating is just tweezing (and I've been tweezing all of my life so no biggee)!

What's that, an airplane? Because it sure does not taste normal to me! The aftertaste is enough to make you want to demand your money back!

"We received this gift for the holidays. I've seen it, but would never have bought it since there were none on display to try.This toy is AWESOME!!! The clarity of the voices and music is incredible! A quality toy! The music is so cool, for adults too! It plays the style of music of whatever toy is being played with. The trumpet plays New Orleans style, the cello plays cello music, piano keys play piano music, etc.There are 2 volume settings. The lowest setting is perfect!This toy is EXTREMELY durable and sturdy for trying to stand up.I would give this toy 10 stars for durability if I could!",toys games,electronics for kids,electronic toys
I was excited to get this product for my 7 week old son. Once I got home the excitement went away. He would not suck on nipple and had no interest in it. Like many others i primed it by sucking on it then read the instructions. The milk did stay in the nipple but my son will only take the wide platex bottles and will not even attempt to drink from this one. This bottle would be great if my son would suck on it.,baby products,feeding,bottle feeding
"My Special Needs Son requires a stroller on most outings (mall, parks, zoo, amusement parks etc.). He can manage short distances. Most strollers are designed up to 50lbs if you are lucky. After that you come up short. This particular stroller we were able to get through insurance, with the seat, padding etc. Just had to purchase the sun and rain equipment seperately. Everything is secure, it has a great long arm reach (no huddling over the arms) and seems to be very comfortable. The foot rests are adjustable - only complaint would be that in order to have it folded that part must come off - but its minor.I highly recommend it for those seeking a secure, comfortable stroller for those over 50lbs or special needs.",baby products,strollers,standard
"The Gun Sniper is a great model and one every zoid fan should have for several reasons. The first is the fact that it is one of the neatest looking zoids produced in the Helic Republic. The second is that it has so many weapons and has high movability, which adds to my point. And last, but not least, is that the Gunsniper is a very fun model to build. The Gunsniper was my first Zoids model and after i built it I had to get more. There is one downside, though. The Gunsniper is a little weak when it comes to drops. Sometimes maybe the two head spikes might detatch or something minor, but the body stays in tact, whatever falls off due to a drop can easily be put back on. I highly recommend the Gunsniper if you like dinasour type zoids and you are a beginner at Zoids Model building.",toys games,vehicles remote control,play vehicles
"I received my Britax Marathon as a shower gift for my first some (2006). I have a lot of friends who use Britax and this came HIGHLY recommended to me. I loved the pattern, we are country at heart and the fabric is amazing. I have washed this seat SEVERAL times and it still looks like new. We used it for DS#1 as a rear facing when he got to big for our infant carrier, I do wish it had a tether specifically designed for the seat when it was rear facing but we made due. We used the tether and fastened it to the frame work of front seat along with securing the latch system....the seat didn't move an inch! DS#1 loved being in this bigger seat. when he was of age and big enough we turned the seat around forward facing and I loved how easy it was to install with the latch system. DS#1 is now almost 4 and about to move into a booster. We will now use this seat for DS#2 when he outgrows the infant carrier....I am sad this seat will expire while DS#2 is still using it but I plan to buy another Britax for him to use.

"This game is a cute boardgame geared towards preschool age and early elementary school aged princesses. Boys need not play. They definitely won't want too with the Princess movers, princess references (the game really feeds into the princess craze!), and bright pink box. The game includes a game board, thick cardboard matresses (the real user pictures appear to have plastic beds, but this is not the case), 4 cardboard princess movers with little stands, and a spinner. Assembly is minimal. The object of the game is to get the most mattresses and become the true princess. The game requires some reading. My 5 year old reads, but my 3.5 year old does not. Both can play though with the reader helping the 3.5 year old. The concept is actually pretty simple, so children younger than the 5+ can play with reading assistance. The game is quick too, which is good for short attention spans.The main flaw is the movers. They are one sided. All of the stands are purple and all of the backs are hot pink. In order to easily keep track of which mover is which, the movers must face the ""wrong way,"" looking away from the goal rather than towards it. The movers should be double sided or the bases should be color coordinated with the movers to make it easier to locate the correct movers.",toys games,games,board games

"The thing I like about it is that my young son could do a couple of the latches when he was 1 year or so, and as he got bigger, he could do some more, and then learned to do the rest by 2.5 years or so. It really grew with him because he got it at a time when he could not master the whole thing. He liked opening the doors and obviously latching and unlatching the locks. It was a good think to also introduce colors and numbers. My baby girl (9 months) is now starting to play with it. It makes a great noise when rattling the chains and locks and I think they like that (but not too loud for you). It is quite sturdy, probably .5 to .75 inch thick. The hinges seem real sturdy and attached in a way that they will not break easily. I think it might last for a good long time, have had it two years probably and has not even begun to break down.",toys games,puzzles,pegged puzzles
"I bought this thing hoping that my 3 cats would have a litter box that doesn't smell, and doesn't have to be scooped by me 3 times a day. And from that aspect, it is keeping it's promise. I now only have to scoop/empty the receptacle once a day. On that note...it is kind of a pain in the butt and sometimes the litter tray is overflowing after only a few hours because one of my cats pees in the same corner all the time...therefore the clumps on that side pile up and overflow the tiny receptacle box on that side and then it doesn't close...and it is stinky. So, then I have to tend to it, which is what I wanted to avoid in the first place. Also I have another cat that pees straight into the motor and the rake and makes it just absolutely disgusting. There's no way around that one either. If you have cats that like to pee on the back of the pan...don't get this box...it will be way more headache than help. My husband refuses to clean this box. He hates it that much. It seems like there are a zillion pieces to take apart, clean, and reassemble...as opposed to a plain old plastic pan with no frills. Also, it's really not that easy to put together. It's been 3 months and it still annoys me a little when reassembling.The only pro that I can see (after 3 months of use by 3 cats) is that if I am gone the entire day...the cats still have a box w/ no huge clumps in there. Other than than, if I hadn't paid so much money, I would get rid of it.More cons",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

Their favorite game was to drag their potty pads all over including into their kennel where they sleep and then shred them to bits and consuming some of it I am sure. This has stopped all that! The tray even has secure pad catchers in the middle allowing you to secure the pads flat to the surface to prevent wrinkling when they walk across the pad or if your pups are like my little Liberty, she likes to scratch her hind legs after she relieves herself. These catchers hold them in place. It takes two pads to cover then entire surface, but worth it! I highly recommend this product. It is easy to clean up and move around the house.

"I remember this stuff from my childhood. I've heard it referred to as ""hippy soap"". I remember the ""peppermint tingle"". However, it wasn't until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own. I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place. There were quite a few items that needed to be investigated...I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG's Skin Deep. So I found body wash, soap, shampoo, dish rinse, laundry detergent, toothpaste...and then I found Dr. Bronners...one product to handle all those tasks. It sure made things easier!Just think about how all of those products are going on your skin at some point...and then being absorbed...multiple times a day, every day, for years...the bombardment of toxic chemicals is crazy and once you start thinking about it you realize how ridiculous our culture has become with no oversight whatsoever.Dr. Bronner's carries ""Champion Status"" at the Environmental Working Group's website that ranks products based on their danger/toxicity. This means they have signed a pledge to use only the safest ingredients in all their products. On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the safest), this product scores a 1. I think if you averaged the scores of all the products I have replaced with it, you'd get about a 5.I now buy it by the gallon and have just purchased my second one (3 months later).

"Its not a magic pill but if your dieting properly and exercising this is a great supplement to assist in burning fat as energy. Its a non-stimulant so you wont feel any added energy from it but since your cells are water based fat cells can't travel into the cell to be burned for energy. L-Carnitine is water soluble so it attaches itself to a fat molecule and passes it through the cell wall which can then be used as fuel. Other than that the only muscle in the body that burns fat exclusively as a source of energy is the heart. Hence, target heart rate during cardio and thermogenic fat burners which speed up your heart rate.I take 3 tablets a day and follow a strict exercise and diet program.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements

"I bought this on a lark after seeing that it was an energy booster. They're not kidding. I'm a grad student and rarely get enough sleep (and really, how many of us do?), but after a smoothie with a spoonful of maca in the afternoon, I fell asleep effortlessly that night and then nearly exploded out of bed the next day (badly startling my poor bf, I'm afraid--he's always been a morning person, but I generally am a hard sleeper and require lots of loud noise, multiple alarm clocks and strong coffee in the morning to get going.) I've been charging out of bed every morning since. Yet there's no caffeine jitters, no crazy buzz; you can sit quietly or go work out or read or whatever you normally do.The taste--well, it's got a little bit of an unpleasant bite, and I find myself adding more fruit, agave nectar or stevia to my smoothies to compensate. Maca is also sold toasted (or maybe roasted?) and is supposed to be sweeter and much tastier that way, so if the taste is bothersome and you don't care if it's raw or not, that might be a good option.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements
"A lot of people pan this 1974 album, but this is Ten Years After returning to their roots -- and doing it superbly.After Woodstock, everybody got Alvin Lee fever, but TYA'S sound was NEVER a one-man-act. I own all of Lee's post-TYA stuff, and he's never yet put out anything that can touch the TYA stuff as far as I'm concerned. Although ""Zoom"" is darn good.That's because TYA was a BAND, where each individual player was a master of their own instrument and played their own material for each song, with the product jelling as music.What's nice about this CD is that the mixes and arrangements allow each instrument equal presence -- just like it was on ""Cricklewood Green"" and ""Watt"" -- not consistently shoving the guitar out front, but making sure it's there when it's got the lead spot.If I had to compare the sound and style of ""Positive Vibrations"" I would call it a mix between ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time"" -- truly, two classic TYA albums.It has the excellent timing changes within the body of songs like ""Watt,"" and great use of acoustic guitar like ""A Space in Time.""Bass, keyboard, and drums consistently play distinctive elements of the songs, not just background reference for the lead guitar.Speaking of which, Lee's work on this album is -- there's no other words for it -- superbly tasteful. He's not trying to show off at all, but works his notes into intricate patterns that, again, are reminiscent of ""Watt.""Although 1972's ""Rock N Roll Music to the World"" is an excellent album, the sound, mix, and production on that album was and is too Alvin Lee-focused, but with ""Positive Vibrations"" it is the band playing as the band again -- cleanly, and doing it well.As for the lyrics, they're written with the same flavor and level of skill that any of Lee's other stuff ever was. I like them. He's a guitarist, not Wordsworth.Anyway, if you listen to this album and think ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time,"" and enjoy TYA's jazz/blues rock fusion material, you'll find this album grows on you.It is really very, very good, and it is a sad statement of the times -- then, and now -- that the legend of Alvin Lee's blistering fingers still overshadow the last great effort the full band put out in their original days.If you dust this baby off, I think you'll find a true Ten Years After gem.It does not appear to be remastered, however. Neither BGO's website, nor the CD make that statement. Only the Amazon.com description. But the sound is still excellent because the original was done properly.Enjoy.",health personal care,sexual wellness,unknown

"Okay, what a stunning doll she is! This diva has crimped shiny gold blonde hair that's silky-to-the-max! What an adorable silver barrett that is placed in her hair! Barbie has simple pink and blue make-up, with bubble-gum pink lipstick. How sweet she looks!Her accessories are hot-pink hoop earrings and a shiny butterfly bracelet. Her pink knit shrug is too-cute! Underneath, she wears a pink tank w/ a beautiful butterfly. Just to let ya' know, her arms are PERMENANTLY bent in the posistion they are in. You can still move them up n' down, but no bending them. I guess it was so she could easily hold her guitar(which is really hard). Her denim capris are folded up once with golden string hemming. There are two little pink frillies running up her white-striped pants. The brown leather belt has pink stitching, and has a silver butterfly pendant on her right hip and 2 silver plus four gold strings hanging off it. Her sandals are made of a 'cork' looking material with maroon blossoms. Her rubbery pink purse has four charms (star, heart, flower, and of course butterfly). Then Barbie's amplifier is REALLY loud. The guitar is attached to the amplifier. When trying to put this doll on display, I just use the amp as a seat. It looks great! Barbie did come with a pencil(which I have yet to sharpen), a diary(which I have yet to write in), and a whole bunch of cheap cardboard magazines(which I just chunked in the garbage).

"I am currently on my second container of Gaspari's SuperPump 250. I have tried NO Xplode, a similar Nitric Oxide product.With the NO Xplode I got decent pumps and excellent focus for about the first two weeks. After time I grew more and more tolerant, to the point where 2.5 scoops was barely noticeable.I decided to switch to SuperPump, mainly because it was $15 cheaper. I'm so glad that I did. I currently take 2 heaping scoops of SuperPump with a half tsp. of creatine ethyl ester before every workout. In 20-30 minutes my head is rushing, my muscles are pumping, and I have an incredible feeling of focus and energy. I can work out harder, my muscles get incredibly pumped, and my veins grow more distinguishable. SuperPump also helps to burn fat. The best part is that the effects of SuperPump last for about 2 hours, and I still get the same if not more effect as I did on the very first day.Side Effects:-Smelly Gas every now and then-Change in stool consistency.-Drowsiness after wearing off (if you take too late at night)-Light Headedness (if you are dehydrated)Before using SuperPump there are a few things you should know.-I've only tried Blue Raspberry. It's an acquired taste but it is definitely manageable. No gagging like I did with NO-Xplode Lemon Lime-Take it on an empty stomach and don't eat or drink anything but water for at least 20 minutes after taking! Otherwise your SuperPump may turn into SuperPoop.-This is not for the casual gym goer. This is for regular, explosive workouts to put on lean muscle.-Not good for aerobic workouts. I've tried it and I feel like my muscles get too pumped. It hinders range of motion a bit and I get slightly queasy.-Start small. One scoop the first couple times. Once you get used to it up to 1.5 scoops. Then go to 2. Then if you really want to get pumped go for 2 heaping or 2.5 I have felt no need to go with 3.-It says on the package to take on off days. Don't. It's a waste of money.-Drink lots of water!-I'd recommend cycling. I do 3 months on and 1 month off, in conjunction with my creatine.If you follow those tips you should minimize side effects and get fantastic results. I will never go back to a different Nitrogen product.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements

This product does what it says it will do. I think the product probably works best for people with min to mod hair loss. You can see the product on your scalp in the right lighting close up. The product will rub off in your hands so you should use hair spray to help hold it in place. I have balding in front and crown. I'm a 43 year old male. Matching the right hair color is essential. I use a combination of med brown and light brown. I found it helped even the color out best for me. I no it isn't that detectable because I work with very honest people and if they had detected it they would have commented. One person I work with noticed something different and commented my hair looked thicker but he couldn't detect the product. I can tell it's there I guess because I know it is and to me the product just covers your scalp. Thats why I think it works best for people with min to mod hair loss. This product would be very apparent if you have hardly no hair. It is fairly easy to use and you do have to clean up the bathroom counter top after application.

Buyer Beware!I bought this stroller to be different from the Bugaboo crowd in NYC. I loved the look of it &#150; stylish, sturdy, durable, different... But this thing is a giant. It weights a ton and is not easy to travel with. We have an Outback and it barely folds down enough to fit in the back.If you live in an apartment or house with stairs (we have 3 steps up to our front door) it is too big and heavy to carry with one person, so be warned. My baby is 7 months now and I am heading out to buy a Maclaren Stroller.",baby products,strollers,standard
"I've had various Braun razors since I was in bootcamp almost 15 years ago and my company commander required my face to be cleanshaven at all times. This meant I had to shave 4 times a day. The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful, and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.I've been a solid Braun customer ever since. Unfortunately, while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool, Gillette (the owner of the Braun brand for several years) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts. The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy, the 7000FC replacement combo isn't. After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use, the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes. These end up giving you nasty, painful small cuts. The cutter too wears down a bit. I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30% less time and is generally closer. Well worth buying.One other note. This product is a great reason to sign up for Amazon Prime. Repeated free two day shipping on a product at a substantial discount to stores - I don't know how Amazon makes money on these transactions, but I'm glad they're letting us do them!",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"Well, I have finally hit that age where I noticed a shadow above my upper lip appearing...(where IS that graceful aging??)...I tried plucking a few hairs, but that didn't seem feasible on my whole upper lip..so I went ahead and bought this product. I tried bleaching first, but that seemed to burn and I had to wipe it off before it actually lightened the hairs. Waited a month and tried this...only left it on for the 3 minutes and it didn't seem to remove all the hairs, especially the coarser ones. At that point, my skin was already starting to burn and become red. I applied a cold compress as directed on the instructions and am hoping I don't have to walk around for a few days with this redness. I too did the patch test. Apparently the skin on the upper lip is much more sensitive. Wondering what else I can use now. Guess I might have to try a wax product. Would not recommend.",beauty,skin care,unknown
"Growing up, my family always loved playing games, so now that I am starting a family of my own, I've been collecting old favorites for my own ""game library."" The Game of Life was one of the first games I purchased, but I could not have been more disappointed in the quality of the ""new and improved"" game.The game I grew up with had the buildings, bridges, houses, etc. permanently embedded into the game board. With the new game, these 3D decorations come off and and have to be placed on the board each time you play. This is my main complaint with the new game. Every time you accidently knock the board or brush one of the buildings with your sleeve, they fall off. Add to this the age-old problems of people not staying in the cars and the spinner not working properly (it's worse in the new game, by the way) and The Game of Life becomes a game of frustration.After one game with the new game board, our family decided we would not play the game again. I am now looking on auction sites trying to find one of the ""old fashioned"" game boards. They really took a step backwards with this one.",toys games,games,board games

"This is a decent shaver for the price... (hopefully you buy it for less than fifty).It does a very good job on my blond weak stubble, so perhaps I'm not the best person to review, as my hair is fine and not too hard to shave off in the first place.The electric shaver irritates my skin a bit, but all shavers do that, I was hoping this might be better. It isn't. (Nivea lotion works wonders however).One thing I noticed is on a FULL charge, if you use the shaver right after unplugging it from the wall, it works AWESOME. The next day, not so much (the motor sounds like it is going slower). The day after that, a bit slower, and usually within 4-5 days it is struggling to keep me clean shaven. So, I'd recommend this shaver to use at your house, and keep plugged in all the time, and you will not be disappointed, it's a great shaver. Not the best one to keep in your car for 5 o'clock shadow or for travelling in the Amazon jungle with no power outlets in sight.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"I always have dry lips and am a lip balm junkie as a result. Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn't matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective. My lips would flake and feel sore, uncomfortable, and dry, and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely. It was so annoying and distracting. No matter what I would be doing (working, cooking, reading etc) I would be constantly distracted by the discomfort of my chapped lips.The problem cropped up recently, and I tried everything this time -- Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar. None of these things worked. Dryness and discomfort would return in short order.So I googled for remedies and kept seeing recommendations for Aquapfor. I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing. Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable. I kept applying periodically, and by the next morning my lips were almost all healed. In about 24 hours my lips were essentially healed. This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.Petrolatum is 41% of the ingredients, but NO, this is not at all like Vaseline even though it may look and feel like it. I had tried both Vaseline and creamy Vaseline for my severely chapped lips, and neither made a difference. Aquaphor did. So don't believe the reviewers who say it is the same. The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).I also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well. It's too greasy to use in the daytime though.I am now a big lifetime fan of this ointment/cream. It's amazing.",health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care

"My husband and I love this bottle warmer. We Put two bottles in it before bed with the ice pack and all we have to do is go to the baby's room and pour the water in the heating chamber, put the bottle in and press the button. We change her diaper while the bottle is warming and usually warms it just about perfect. Measuring the correct amount of water to put in the chamber is the key. There are instructions right on the side of the bottle storage area on how much water to put in the chamber depending on what you are warming up. I have really enjoyed and used a few of the First Years products and they all have been easy to use and make being a new mommy that much less stressful. If you use the Dr. Browns Bottles, make sure you remove the two parts of the bottle that go inside before you heat it up, the pressure of the heat builds up and will cause the bottle to leak and the hot plate will keep on warming as long as there is fluid on it to steam. Then you have a mess on your hands. (our daughter uses the Dr. Browns bottles because she sucks a lot of air sometimes when we are feeding and she has been quite colicky!)

Does not come with two batteries (like I had previously read he would) - but no big deal. Personally, I'm not really all that impressed by the so called 'life stages' that Pleo goes through. To me, it seemed like it was nothing more than a whole lot of honking an hooting - some clumsy movements - some improved movements - and some more honking an hooting. My son has him playing with his training leaf quite frequently (in fact, it's pretty much all he really does now) - but Pleo doesn't seem to care if he's playing with his leaf, or anything else at that matter (like my son's finger... no, he doesn't bite hard enough to hurt.) In all honesty, it just seems very 'unaware' of it's surroundings, unless you're physically in contact with it. Cool concept, but I'm not completely sold. Being a true geek at heart, I was kind of hoping for more. I think if you're sincerely interested in purchasing one, you should wait for a deal, because I don't think it's worth it's current selling price.

"This litter is the best I've used. I hated clay--it stunk unless you scooped it right away and there were the awful dust clouds (who knows what that does to lungs?) We likedNature's Earth Feline Pine - The Healthy Cat Litter (40-lb bag)because it absorbed odor extremely well; I didn't mind that it didn't clump because you couldn't smell the absorbed urine. We didn't even have to scoop daily for our little cat. Even after a week of not scooping, a visitor said he couldn't smell it! The main trick with Feline Pine was that you needed a special scoop that picked out the solid waste but let the pine pellets through. We actually filed down the bars on a wide slot scoop to make it work better. And of course, you needed patience to train your cat, but following package directions took care of that. We got used to it, and we were very happy, but had to go to certain stores to find it, and sometimes they were out. I looked into buying it online, but the pine pellets are heavy, and shipping was therefore exhorbitant.When I didn't have time to go to the store that carried it, I found Cedarific in my favorite grocery. I thought it might work. I was astounded at how great it worked for me! It's lightweight, so it's easier carrying the bag in, pouring it into the litter box and bringing the box to the bathroom to scoop the solids. We have a large Booda DomeDome, Cleanstep Cat Box, Irisand a small cat; we only need to scoop it once a week. I have it right under my PC desk--it smells great--even better than the pine pellets! We can use a normal fine slot scoop. But best of all, if my store stops carrying it, I can afford to have this seller on Amazon ship it at $.[...] a pound plus a few dollars for the per shipment rate, because it's light.

"Heck, who hasn't heard of K-Y Jelly? K-Y brand has been in the lubricant field since 1917! But, K-Y Warming Jelly is a newer product. It has a certain something in it that causes it to give a mild warming feeling on contact - this can be quite nice if you are prone to feeling cold, as I am.Overall, I found this to be a pretty good lubricant, and I liked the warming properties. Now, among its ingredients is ""Acacia Honey,"" and some people say that it is more likely to cause a yeast infection than regular water-based lubricants. I haven't heard one way or another from anyone authoritative, and haven't experienced a yeast infection since I started using it, but you might want to keep that in mind. The worst downside to me, though, is the taste. If you use this stuff, and then get it into your mouth, you will find it to have an odd, bitter taste that is probably the ingredient trying to ""warm"" your tongue.So, I would say that this is a pretty good lubricant, one with a bad taste. So, if you are considering using this lubricant, you will have to decide if the balance of positives to negatives is worth it or not. Overall, I like it.FYI",health personal care,sexual wellness,safer sex
"As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing",beauty,skin care,face

In a few instances, we have found the lowest prices to be found at web sites that have sold us out of date merchandise. Both my wife and I have been disappointed to make a fragance purchase online, but when used, did not have long lasting impact hoped for when bought.Our solution?Call the web site directly, and ask when the product was produced, when it arrived at their warehouse, and how long it has been in their inventory.

"..but it doesn't. It is true that if you follow the instructions exactly, some of the clumps will in fact dump into the tray - with a moderate amount of clean litter as well. But - some of the clumps stick to the grid inside as well as to the sides, and just get bigger and bigger. And it does not touch clumps that are just small enough to go through the grid and back, so they build up. These would ordinarily be picked up with a hand scoop.In order to really clean it, you have to roll it back and forth, dump the clumps while at the same time not dumping all the litter that's perfectly good in the tray with them. Then you have to open it, scrape out the big chunks that have adhered to the grid and side, and dump them. Compared to the time that it would take for a plain box with a lift off top and a hand scoop, this takes way longer. So I just use it like a regular litterbox - take off the top, scoop out the clumps and dump them. A big disappointment, overall, and NOT cheap. Too bad..",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"It's a shame that Amazon is no longer carrying this item. I bought mine in November 2009 for $26.99 - a great price.I have been fortunate with the use of this toothbrush and, touch wood, that will continue. Previously I had had a ""normal"" type Sonicare but not the latest model. This toothbrush has outperformed it in every way. I much prefer the relatively light brushhead and battery performance has been phenomenal. I am using two very high capacity rechargeable 2400 MAh batteries - an Alkaline AA has about 600MAh - and the first charge lasted over 2 months!!!I suspect that battery capacity may be a factor in the performance experienced by other reviewers. The toothbrush is driven of course by an electric motor which will demand a relatively high amperage (in contrast with the current drawn by a TV remote, for example). The greater the capacity of the battery, the longer the motor will be able to perform without any hiccups. In the second month of my first charge period, I did experience a few stoppages but found that these were easily fixed by removing the brushhead and putting it back on. It may have been that some accumulated debris was causing friction that prevented the motor from turning - particularly as the charge in the batteries was depleted. I have not - fingers crossed - experienced any of the water related issue mentioned by other reviewers. The battery compartment seems very tight and waterproof to me and, again, I wonder whether the problems that have been ascribed to water-related causes would have occurred with higher capacity batteries.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"The Blue light is the only thing that has helped me have a normal life for the last two years. I used the bright lites starting in 1996 and they helped a bit but nothing like this device.I went to the sites described by some reviewers here. These sites do expound that this blue light may affect AMD. This includes the bright lights and also the sun - it is not limited to this device. To get the same therapeutic affect with the bright lights and the sun I would need several hours more a day so the total blue light would be the same. I read Rosenthal's new book and I do not believe he checked into the lights much as he dismisses them off-hand.I have no choice but to use the blue light. Before I bought mine I suffered suicidal depression, an inability to have coherent speech, and a affect on my body where the slightest effort was not worth it. The bright lights diminished this affect but the blue light eliminated it, except for a bit of lethargy in the dark winters.There are many medications out there that cause complications if the user is not carefull and maybe the blue light is one of them. Even the medication alternatives to light therapy cause problems. I can not go back to the way I felt prior to this product and will not. I will limit my light time to 30 minutes as recommended by the manufacturer. This is after all a medical device and as such should only be used by people who suffer S.A.D.A note",health personal care,health care,alternative medicine

"I really like using this monitor - the picture is usually clear enough; sometimes I need to adjust the anntena or move the monitor around the table. The video monitor gave me such peace of mind, especially when I was trying to get my daughter to sleep through the night. The audio is great. I can even hear the baby rolling over and sometimes even hear her breathing. The only thing is, the units don't last. My sister-in-law gave me hers, and after about 9 months the monitor stopped working. I got a replacement, but the night video (infrared) didn't work from the beginning. Safety 1st replaced the entire set with their latest model, which is the one I'm reviewing. It worked great for 7 months, and again, the night video (infrared) just quit. My husband thought it's because I leave the camera on 24/7, but the other reviews are proving that this product is just very short-lived.

"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products.

When I did they came up on your site which we consider reliable and trust worthy and you had a good price and shipping deal. So we can't miss.

No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.I used to drink regular Red Bull but I found that my eyes would really hurt from all of the sugar and that there would be a pretty substantial crash a few hours after consumption.

"We have three of these, two bears and one puppy. Each of my three youngest has one. My five year old wanted one so badly for Christmas and when she got it she was elated.

He loves to look at the puppy while he goes to sleep at night. The wand which you can buy seperatley or it comes with the bears, lights all three of them at the same time from anywhere in the house. This is a great feature at night when the baby wakes up because I can turn it on from my bed and he will go back to sleep. My 22 month old turns it on to walk down the hall at night as well.

"I was asked to find a practical Christmas present. Not my most exciting task, a practical, not a fun, gift. I am now grandpa of triplets. My daughter and son-in-law were looking for a home otoscope. I did a lot of looking and found the Dr. Mom Otoscope. I read the reviews and was still skeptical that an otoscope of this cost could be useful. I have used the WA otoscope for about 40 years. I was pleasantly surprised by the Dr. Mom Slimline Stainless LED Otoscope. I would have used it for routine exams. It was lightweight and easy to carry in my pocket. I got a chance to demo it on adults and grandchildren, it worked great. I was happy with the amount of light, and the optics. The WA otoscope is brighter and the light adjustable but much heavier to carry. They are not comparable, and have different uses. The Dr. Mom scope is well suited for home use, and light clinic use. There were some useful pictures supplied of the tympanic membrane. A little caution, examination of a sick child is not fun, especially your own.",health personal care,personal care,ear care

However, I was not anticipating how much fun my 4 year old and even 8 year old would have with this as well! In fact, my 4 year old spent hours yesterday in the ""kitchen"" with these, slicing the food and cooking with it. When we first opened this up, we explored all the different items and pulled it apart by hand. (The orange is especially complex as it comes in four pieces and the skin comes off of all four pieces.) However, the knife that comes with it makes pealing and slicing much easier - and fun! What kid gets to actually use a sharp knife to cut up food? If I could give this item more stars, I would.

"My dog loved this paste! I got the beef flavor. I've only brushed his teeth once so far, but after I was done, he kept following me wanting more :) It was definitely a good idea to introduce the dog to the paste first and then to try either the finger brush or the tooth brush. My dog is a 2 year old Bichon-Pomeranian mix, so I'm a little behind on when I should have started brushing, but he didn't seem to mind it. I agree with another poster who said that the dog would chew on the toothbrush when the paste was on it & made a game out of it.

"I've used a blow dryer and round brush to style my layered, collar-length, thick hair for over many years, and I have no problem getting the look I want. However, I don't have as much luck when I try to use the brush and dryer on my 8-year-old daughter's hair, which is one length to her shoulders. It just felt like I needed a third hand to make it all work with her thick hair! I decided it was time to try something new, and I'm glad I chose the Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush! I was able to use it successfully on myself with the first try, and it gets easier and easier. The fact that it has different brush attachments is a real plus for me since I get my hair trimmed about every 6 weeks to keep the layers in shape. The smaller brush is perfect for when it is newly cut and a bit shorter, and once it grows for a week or two I can move up to the larger brush. The third attachment would be useful for drying any hair style in a manner similar to a regular hair dryer, although I don't think I will use it in that way. I had good results with my daughter's hair, too. Because I don't have to use one hand for a brush and another for a dryer, I have a free hand to divide her thick hair into sections, which makes it possible to dry it much more quickly. I can give her a cute flip or a soft under curl before she gets bored and impatient!

"UPDATE:So after using this cup for 3 weeks now, I have to admit that it leaks SOMETIMES! When first reassembled after washing, the cup does not leak ... even when vigorously shaken upside down! Once my daughter drinks out of it .... one of three scenarios has happened:1) the cup still does not leak when vigorously shaken upside downOR2) the cup leaks a few drops before stopping even when shaken (I think this is liquid that is left in the spout after already passing through the valve)OR3) the cup leaks when shaken.I have not quite figured out yet why it leaks sometimes and not other times. Anyway, my daughter still loves this sippy and I will keep using it since she is usually in the highchair when drinking.As for assembling the cup ... it has become much easier, and it works best if I pull (and wiggle) the spout through the lid instead of pushing the spout through the lid from the inside.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't think this cup is as bad as other reviewers rated it. Yes, it does have some design issues (and maybe Thermos is ""listening""), e.g it is really difficult to reassemble and you need to align the spout (purple) exactly into the lid (pink) or the sippy does not close right (I assume that's why other say it leaks). But if assembled correctly this sippy does not leak. Another plus is that it is made of durable stainless steel, therefore BPA-free and healthier than other plastic sippies. If this means that I have to put a little bit more effort into reassembling it, so be it. The only issue I have with this sippy is that i don't see how much my daughter is drinking, but that is expected of a stainless steel cup.I also own the BornFree Training Cup (not the BornFree Drinking Cup!), but my 6 month old daughter prefers the Foogo. Personally I don't really like the spout of the BornFree Training Cup because there is not much difference between the spout and a bottle nipple ... they both have a y-cut (so what's the point of transitioning to a cup?) and the valve is not directly attached to the inside of the spout (guess that's why they need the leak-proof y-cut ... also why their Drinking Cup leaks).",baby products,feeding,solid feeding

She doesn't like to walk by herself yet, but with this walker she is all smiles and going as fast as those little legs will take her.

"And if you got this as a gift, realize that person probably hates you.I got this as an impulse buy at a retail pet store and finally got around to installing it today. Or should I say ""attempting"" to install it. As most of the reviews state, this product is deeply flawed. This design is sold under more than one company name, so watch out. Literally nothing fits the way it should. Yes I do mean ""literally"". The picture only instructions are ambiguous or just plain wrong and there are no written instructions. Oh, and if you make it to the end, where the instructions show a picture of a hacksaw shortening the screws to allow the end caps to fit, it won't work. The screws need to be slightly shorter than the opening, not flush with it the way the will be when you are done. It would have been nice to know that before I spent 20 sweaty minutes sawing through metal.Trying to install this thing was an exercise in frustration. I spent 2 hours trying to make this work and have given up. The stress this thing caused me probably took a year off my life. I haven't been this mad in a long time. I now have a circular hole in my door and I only hope I can find a slightly larger pet door to install or I will have to replace my door.What have I learned from this experience?

"I bought this for my 3 year old's birthday online thinking it would be cute to wear with the Dora costume. Had I seen it in the store first I wouldn't have bought it. Whoever designed this needs to be sent back to the drawing board. With today's technology you can't tell me that the necklace, which plays music, couldn't be made lighter and smaller. The ring is even too big for me to wear, let alone my little girl. The bracelet fits my 11 month old better than my three year old. I don't know what kind of measurements they used designing this one, but they evidently did not try it out on an actual child. The necklace is too heavy to stay on and the ""chain"" part is just large enough to go around my daughter's neck so that the HUGE flower sits just below her chin for the few seconds it stays on.",toys games,dress up pretend play,beauty fashion

"Well here is my review on the Clone Scout Walker. For those of you who don't know, this machine's real name is the AT-RT.This is one of those ""meh"" sets.First of all, let me point out that the set is WAY bigger than it should be. The AT-RT is the height of two clones. This is about twice the size of the movie version then. The head is wrong as well. But hey, nothing a simple modding can do. Overall, the set itself looks pretty nice and is fairly simple to build. Mind you, it is not the most durable set, but we have all seen worse.I do, however, like the fact that on the side of the walker, there is an opening where you can put the clone's ""blaster rifle"" in. This makes for easy displaying. Apparently a long time ago, bullhorns could be used as ranged weapons.The clone itself is actually out of place in this set. If you own the Clone Turbo Tank, switch the green trooper with the red one in this set. If you don't, don't worry about it. The set is ok either way. The clone is extremely well down in my opinion. Lego always seems to outdue themselves with the different markings. This clone has some nice dark red markings.All in all, this is an average set. If you don't like the walker, scrap it for parts to use later and use the clone in your clone army. For $10, this is a nice and cheap way to army build. And since it's only $10, you don't have to worry about a money issue. Should you get it? I say that you at least get one.",toys games,building toys,building sets

"The dominant flavor of the Chai Tea bars is Cardamom. Although it contains tea, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, etc., they have not really balanced the flavors, and you will likely notice only the cardamom flavor. If you're thinking this bar will taste like tea, forget it. Emphasis strongly on the word Chai, not Tea. (Chai tea is flavored with cardamom and other spices.) If you don't know what cardamom tastes like, it's one of the staple spices of Indian cooking, comes in pods with small black seeds (which, by the way, are great to drop in a cup of coffee...)

It plays two songs, beeps, and makes a ""voom voom"" sound.One thing I like about this bus is that it moves only by kid-power, not a motor or wind up, so it can't go too fast and bump into things. It tends to engage the kids in more quiet play, rather than some of the motorized toys that zoom around the house. Also the noises that it makes are not too loud.This toy has paid for itself in terms of the amount of use it gets.

"Having clean, fresh water is extremely important for any pet and the Drinkwell Pet Fountain does a fantastic job of providing that.Let's start with how it works. Water from the reservoir flows into the base where a motorized pump brings the water to the waterfall reservoir. Then the water runs through a carbon filter and is released into the bowl. From the bowl, the water passes through a screen, to remove any hair or large debris that could clog the motor, back to the base where it is recirculated. This circulation keeps the water fresh, filtered, and clean.The water reservoir holds probably about a half gallon of water and lasts my kitten three to four days. There is also an adjustable flow intensity that can increase or decrease the waterfall flow rate. While running, the drinking fountain makes a low hum that doesn't disturb me or my kitten. I only have one gripe gripe with this system - it's difficult to clean. The entire fountain is essentially designed in three pieces - the reservoir, base/bowl, and waterfall reservoir. Oftentimes, only the bowl needs cleaning but there is no way to clean it individually by the way it is assembled. A removable bowl conducive to quick cleaning would make this a five star product.Pros:Fresh flowing filtered waterLarge water reservoirMy cat loves itCons:ExpensiveNot suitable for large dogsNo removable bowlBottom line",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies
"This is a terrible product!! This does not get hot enough!! Bristles are too short and they are flexible....so they don't wrap around the hair very well. If it heated up to a higher temperature maybe I could deal with the bristles. The tip is the only part that gets hot.....too hot to touch. Your hair gets caught in between a gap at the end of the barrel and the handle and rips your hair out. Also, the placement of the On/Off switch is terrible because as you are trying to curl your hair it keeps switching to Off. It is all around a bad product. The only thing it kind of works on is to turn under the ends of my 2 year old's baby fine hair.........even then it doesn't hold the curl very well. Still not hot enough. I don't know why I even decided to give this a try because I own 2 other Helen of Troy products and I don't care for them either. Go with the Conair Instant Heat 1.25 inch with the 25 settings.

"We recently remodeled all three of our bathrooms. We used this Grab Bar in the Polished Chrome or Brushed Nickel finish in all three bathrooms. Six in total. In each shower we mounted one horizontally and one vertically. In the bathroom with the spa tub, we mounted it over each wall where you get in and out of the tub. Although I don't have severe mobility issues, it is just great to have these grab bars at hand. Makes getting in and out of the tub almost effortless and infinitely safer, and it's there to lean on when shaving or washing feet in the shower. Of course, they're there to prevent falls, but useful even when not an emergency fall. It's a relatively expensive grab bar, but it is so much more attractive than standard metal or plastic ones that they are worth it. My contractor mounted them with additionally purchased extra heavy duty molly bolts (bought at local hardware store) since he felt the ones they came with were inadequate (why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). These are mounted VERY securely. I'm heavy and my husband is heavier and they feel secure when we put all our weight on them. I also love the rubber pads on the underside. You can't really see that in the picture. But I originally bought the first couple at Lowe's and was able to compare the various brands and styles there.

Finally, you can warm the bottles with all the parts in it, you just need to unscrew the lid first to avoid bubbles forming.",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"I was very unsure how this was going to work when we first ordered this, or if the cats were even going to like it. We have four cats, all different ages. We at one point had four litterboxes, which was a stinking, embarrassing mess. The cats took to this box right away, and it has been a huge blessing. It is as easy as described to use and clean. Like any other litter box, it still needs to be thoroughly cleaned out and have litter levels maintained, but lets face it, rolling a box and emptying the sleeve is alot better than messy scooping.

"I bought this feeder about a month ago for my cat. I'm joking a little when I say life changing but it really is awesome. Prior to the feeder our cat would greet us every morning at 4:30am by running across our bed and jumping on our heads, trying to wake us up to feed him. He would not stop until we feed him. My husband was about ready to get rid of him. Instead I did research on which feeder to buy and this one by far had the best recommendations. The price is a little steep compared to the other automatic feeders on the market but the all the other feeders had really mixed reviews. I thought I'd rather buy one good one then regret buying a sub-par feeder.I was a little overwhelmed by the directions that came with the feeder at first glance. I ended up just following the step by step pictures/directions in the middle of the info packet and was able to put the feeder together, successfully, in about 20 minutes. It was much easier then I thought it was going to be at first glance.Since I put the feeder together it has worked perfectly and I have not had to manually feed my cat since. He no longer wakes us up in the morning and it has been just wonderful. As a side note, my cat is very crafty and smart and he has not found a way to break into the feeder.I HIGHLY recommend this product.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies

"No joke! I bought this for my son for Hanukkah, and he was enthralled with it from the moment he laid eyes on it. A month later, it's still his favorite toy and comes out every single day. The box states that it's for ages 2 1/2+, but my son isn't even 1 1/2 yet, and it's perfectly appropriate for him (although he does need adult help connecting the tracks). With a little trial and error, he was able to figure out how to line up the cars on the track, connect the cars, and operate the remote control all by himself. My wife and I beam with pride at how well he does those things.The physical quality of GeoTrax in general is very sturdy. It's pretty much all solid, heavy-duty plastic, and very few parts seem at all fragile (the windmill blades are thin, but they've survived so far). My son is in a throwing-stuff phase, but even the motorized locomotives have laughed off everything he's dished out. The stylized look of the gear is nice, too. The bright colors and chunky objects are great for very small children, but there's enough detail to appeal to older kids and adults as well. A GeoTrax set sprawling across our family room isn't so bad-looking.Whoever came up with the track-connection system is a genius. The pieces are very easy to snap together and pull apart, although they stay perfectly connected during play, at least when the child isn't in Godzilla mode.

Two pieces of its right wing and laser canon needs to be sloted into the turbine engine and you're done.The model is scaled almost perfectly to the studio models used in filming. Earlier Star Wars X-Wing models in the late 70s are out of proportion and is clearly meant as a play toy. This model is large and when assembled looks terrific. Scale modellers can do more with the rudimentary painting to give it more colour and realistic weathering.There is alot of detail in the model although they are not very accurate compared to the real scale models. Nonetheless this is a great model and one will find it hard to display it unless you have a really large cabinet.I hang my model from the ceiling using nylon fish lines as I have no place to display it.

"At this point, I've bought this monkey five times - for friends, the children of friends, extended family members, and charitable donations. This dude is awesome.The first time, I found him after hunting pretty extensively through the entire FAO Schwarz store in New York. I was looking for a gift for a newborn, and none of the other stuffed animals really lived up to snuff. It's hard to beat this dude for softness, cuteness, and huggyness. He's cute, he's soft, he's squishy, he's got the right heft and the right size. I don't like stuffed animals that have hard bits (other than the eyes); animals with joints tend to be less cuddly and less durable. I also think stuffed animals are more satisfying if they're of a certain size; beanie baby types tend to be too small to get a decent hug out of. ""Mambo"" is a little small for a full-sized adult hug, but he ought to do fine for any child, and he'd be a perfect companion-sized dude for an infant. The other thing about Mambo is that he's a pretty uniformly cute model; sometimes you'll buy stuffed animals and since each particular stuffed animal differs ever so slightly in the stitching, you'll get one that looks mean or scowly or something. I've bought Mambo five times, and every time he's been a happy, pleasant-faced little dude.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures

"I purchased this swing to go with the Kettler swing set. It fit great and had the same colors, so I thought it would work for our 2 year old.

"As a straight male I workout 5 days a week all year around, im rather pale especially after winter. I use this product so when summer hits I can enjoy the beach and work on my tan asap without blinding everyone. That dark tone really shows the definition in your muscles its great! Also this is alot cheaper then paying 60 bucks a month to visit a tanning salon with nice beds. Cakes on skin pretty thick I use Cocoa butter with this product in a 1:3 ratio 1 parts being the Cocoa butter. It helps spread alot faster and evener while making the smell enjoyable. The product alone doesnt smell bad but its not good either. Ive smelled worse like the stuff you spray on, makes me smell like burnt hotdogs... This will stain anything white without a doubt so dont apply if you plan on wearing light clothing. This product does come off alot in water so know if you apply and havent showered just know that after you get out of the water you will be a couple shades lighter. What I do is shower dry off then apply about an hour before bed so im dry and then shower again the next morning if i want to wear white. Fellas make sure youre clean before application the smallest bit of dirt or sweat will make this stuff gunk up and you will look spotty and terrible. Ive had mine for over a year now and its starting to turn green.. and looks green on skin until its dry. After showering pat yourself dry rubbing will take tan away.Pros",beauty,skin care,sun

my cat and I are very disapointed in this item. i have been searching high and low for a litter box that would control the amount of litter that makes it on to the floor.

My cat is very spry and knocks around in his boxthe dome has come off twicenow. My seccond issue is that for as big as the picture made it out ot be I dont think that the litter box part where the litter goes is really all that big. My 3rd and most triffling problem is that it does not do the job of keeping the litter off of the floor. After setting it up day one same amount of litter on the floor if not a little more.I can say i am extremly disapointed.

"I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old who has down syndrome. I would definitely recommend it for younger ages as well. I wasn't sure if it would be to babyish but you can do a lot with it. It is great for stacking and you have to push each one so it clicks, you can also play peek a boo with it when they are all stacked it makes like a little telescope. The ball on top has a little bell in it and its great to play like a cup game where you take 2 and eventually 3 of the sections and hide the ball and let her guess which one it is under, obviously you show them which one and then let them watch you move them and they they guess. My daughter loves it and gets it right every time. Also for finger dexterity each section is color coordinated with its matching shade and the also all have a number on it and they snap together to make balls. So your child can push them together and also there is a hole on the top of each section so when you make the ball they can pull it apart by putting their index finger in the whole. It is even great for speech with the ""b"" sound for ball and the ""P"" sound for push and pull. It definitely is very functional.",toys games,baby toddler toys,stacking nesting toys

"This is actually a nicely made chess game with a handy touch screen for piece movement. The menu system is a bit convoluted, but after figuring out where things are and reading the instructions a couple of times, you can find things okay. My main complaint about the game is its level settings. At the very lowest level (Beginner 1), the game is still quite difficult for an intermediate player to beat. I would say that the lowest setting equals about a 1500-1600 rated player. This immediately puts this out of the reach of true beginners and children. They will get soundly beaten every time and likely become frustrated. This game would receive a 5 star rating from me if the lowest setting was more like a 400 rated player.

I ordered this set for him as a Christmas gift since I knew it was something that would interest him, but it was not something that he had asked for. After the dust settled under the tree, imagine my surprise when it was the first gift he opened to play with. He very quickly built the ""flying saucer"" and the ""space war"" models. The instructions are fantastic- in color and easy to follow with explanations for each model. And the number of models and variations that can be built with this set will keep him busy for quite some time. He hasn't even had it a week and has played with it 4 or 5 times already. I am also impressed with the quality of this set. The parts seem to be durable and should stand up to the demands of a very curious 8 year old.As for the educational/learning value of this set, I can honestly say that he has truly learned something from playing with it and I think he is very proud of what he has learned. Today he went with me to my office and he started up a conversation with one of the technicians (who was in the process of repairing a large circuit board) about circuit boards, resistors, jumper cords - all items at the technician's station, that he had just learned about with this set.

"This is a great fence/pen for small animals, like rabbits. The panels fold up completely flat against each other for easy storage and carrying. There are no extra parts, no poles to insert in slots to connect panels. You can stretch this out to make a fence that cuts a room in half, or shape it into a square, rectangle, or any shape. If you only need a small fence, the panels fold up easily. All the panels are already connected to each other with very sturdy metal parts. The wires are stiff and sturdy too, can't be bent by the animals -- or you! I live in a humid climate and use this outdoors, but this fence has no sign of rust or discoloration.

"Howdy from Texas. I've been using the Attends products for more than twenty years now and they have hit an all-new low as far as I'm concerned. These briefs (diapers) used to be the pinnacle when it came to adult briefs and now they are worse than depend or any other store band for that mater.I can remember back in the late 80's through the early 2000's when you could go to the store and pickup a bag of these for less than 20 bucks and it would only take two per day for moderate to severe incontinent. When Paperback purchased the product line from P&G; they continued to make the same product for a year or so and then they started making changes.The product is now very poorly made out of a cheap and very loud plastic backing and very thin, not nearly as absorbent as it wants was when made by P&G.; When wet, the cotton material clumps and falls down between your legs and collects there until you change. This is all after the first wetting.The tapes do hold good but you're unable to remove them without ripping the outer plastic. So once your have them on you have them on. If you are able to make it to the restroom, you will need to replace the garment with a new one because you have ripped the outer plastic and have rendered it useless.The absorbency is good for about one to two wettings depending on the amount. If it were a gusher, I would replace it just as soon as I can. Also you will get the smell that go's along with a wet undergarment. There is no hiding the fact that you have yet yourself.Now for the worst part, the leg gathers on each side of the brief will continue to chafe until it causes a sore. So you will need to find another product to change back and forth so that it will not get so irritating that you cannot stand to have the briefs on at all.",health personal care,health care,incontinence

"So I'm a self-professed chili head-- the kind of person who will find a hot sauce to put on ice cream (Toad Sweat if you're curious) and who makes it a habit to challenge places that think they make incredibly hot wings to knock me over. When I see specialty products like this Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, I'm generally inclined to check them out.What I found was a sauce that, while it was tasty, with a nice sweetness to it, was a bit overwhelming in the smokey department and a bit underwhelming in the spice department. Made primarily of raspberries, pickled jalapenos and chipotles, the sauce smells so strongly of smoke, I was initially a bit put off. But a little on a cracker and I found a very natural tasting raspberry flavor blended with the smokiness, with a slight spice kick in the aftertaste. What I didn't detect, much to my disappointment, was much in the way of spiciness or a peppery taste to it. After a few more crackers, I began finding the taste of smoke a bit overwhelming.I find it kind of confusing that such a specialty product didn't cater to the spicy food crowd, and while the product was ok, the overly assertive smokiness of it got a bit in the way. It's not a terrible product by any means, but it's not going to knock you over either.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces

Maybe there is some big scam on Little Tikes parts and they are just trying to control costs, but the funny thing is, and I pointed this out to the CSR, when I had a similar problem with a Fisher Price Laugh & Learn Learning Home (which is just GREAT), Fisher Price apologized for the error, took the order, and I had the right parts in two days!",toys games,sports outdoor play,gym sets swings

If you were to give me one of these bars to eat, and I had to guess what (if any) fruit flavor is in it, I'd be unable to guess. The Blueberry content is definitely there, and the bar tastes good. But I do prefer the cherry & cashew bar.",grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars
"This is a small, pink castle. It has nine rooms and a ""magic"" door. It comes with six Winx Club dolls of Bloom, Stella, Flora, Musa, Tecna, and Icy.The Bloom doll has red hair. She is wearing a blue t-shirt and pants.The Stella doll has blond hair. She is wearing a green shirt and an orange skirt.The Flora doll has light red hair. She is wearing a green shirt and a pink skirt.The Musa doll has blue hair. It is in short pigtails. She is wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.The Tecna doll has purple-pink hair. She a purple and green shirt and purple capris.The Icy doll has white hair in a ponytail. She is wearing a blue shirt and skirt.The playset also comes with a tiny Kiko doll (Bloom's rabbit), two books, a table, a plant, a chair, a jewelry box, a guitar, and something else. I can't tell what it is.There is a ""magic"" door in the middle. When you put a doll inside and close the door when you open it again the doll is gone. You can push it again to get her back. Or you can put one of these dolls in one side and one of the fairy ones (sold seperatley) in the other side so she can transform.Several parts of the castle also play music.My only complaints are that the Icy doll gets stuck in the magic door and that this doesn't resemble the girls' rooms on TV. They each have a seperate room in this set, except for Icy, who doesn't go to Alfea. On TV Bloom and Flora share a room and Musa and Tecna share a room. The only one that is right in this castle is Stella's room. She doesn't have to share a room and hers is bigger than the others in this set.P.S. Someone asked how tall the dolls are. They are almost exactly three inches tall, except Icy's hair makes her a little taller.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets

"I like these. I have tried other systems (strips, washes, rinses, special toothpastes) and these do the job. I have a sensitive constitution and a lot of dental work, however, I had no gum sensitivity or bleeding of any kind -- and I am finicky. The gel takes some practice to master. You need to hold the tray to you teeth and spread the gel up and down, both to distribute it evenly and have a more satisfactory result, as well as to keep it in place. I leave them on for an hour, so as to get my money's worth and there has been no discomfort whatsoever. I do not want to have blue white teeth - just a whiter version of natural enamel and this achieves it.When finished, I always brush my teeth to remove the gel - sometimes with the new foaming, whitening Aquafresh toothpaste and sometimes with food grade peroxide and baking soda, making a paste. It takes off all the residue and my teeth and gums feel clean and sterile. The flavor is pleasant, as well and there was no burning or aftertaste, whatsoever.I cannot say that some people will not experience sensitivity, but since I have not, I was surprised and pleased. Some people will not finesse the 'installation' - patience and skill are required, but it beats having a dentist or specialist do it for many times the price, and the same result.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

In addition to the ceiling display (which other crib toys don't have) there are also volume controls and you can select options from music only to the full show with ceiling display.My husband and I would put our daughter down at night and 9 times out of 10 she would wake up the instant she left my arms and was in the crib. We would just turn ""her birds"" on and she would focus on them and the ceiling display, zone out, and fall alseep on her own. She was usually asleep before it shut itself off.

"I have had my conair flat iron for over 6 years and have never had a problem with it. I figured I was in the market for an updated flat iron so...I have been reading reviews for all of the flat irons. Price wasn't an issue, and honestly I didn't see much of a difference in price vs value. I brought home a Hot Tools flat iron, tried it and hated it! It pulled my hair and was really weird to work with. Tried the Chi, was good, but didn't love it. So I brought it back and decided to go with the pink Remington. I love that it has an automatic turn off in an hour if you forget about it. It displays the degrees digitaly and heats up super fast. It is so easy to manuever and the top isn't hot, so you can use your fingers/both hands to guide the iron and won't burn yourself. Best of all it works great and doesn't pull my hair. It was so smooth going down my hair. I am really glad that I did all of my homework on irons, although what I really learned was expensive doesn't mean that its' better...just more expensive. So I saved money buying the Remington Tourmaline vs a Chi and instead went all out on hair care products(Biosilk) and Hair Mask(Neutrogena Hair mask)etc.. to protect my hair from the heat.

Nice wide plates work on large sections of hair at a time which is perfect for those with long, thick hair like me who don't want to spend an hour on their hair. Multiple heat settings - this baby gets HOT! My hair was so hot when it came out of the plates that it hurt my hands! My hair is very curly and it usually takes me at least three passes to get the curl out, but with this one it was basically completely straight on one long, slow pass.

I can tell you, out of all of the other seats I've ever owned, most of which were ""professionally"" installed still slid side to side and front to back no matter how tight the seat belt was. The LATCH system for this seat makes it easy to install (literally minutes as opposed to a half an hour) and if you put your knee into the seat and press your weight into it while tightening the straps, it won't budge. I could literally try to rock the seat and the car would move but not the seat. By far the only choice for small children, after seeing the difference, $200 is a very small price to pay for peace of mind.",baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

"I built this Heavy Arms Custom Kit for my friend In Afghanistan, its his favorite Gundam. The 1/100 scale of the kit is just right, not to small which is what my fears were. The entire kit will snap together and most of the pieces are painted close to what they need to be, however I painted each piece to the true color and also painted the pilot to look exactly as in the show or how he looks on the box. To make every rocket pod or container open and close smoothly without braking it requires a lot of sanding and fitting, then make sure you dont paint those area's or they will stick. If you simply snap the kit together you will have seams and rough edges from the plastic racks they were attached too. As usual I sanded down everything, glued the pieces and filled with gap filling glue or putty then sanded everything down to have seamless pieces then painted them with an airbrush. I am not a professional modeler, but I have been building for a long time and have acquired a few tools here and there. Once finished the Gundam looked amazing and I was especially proud since it was my first Gundam or Mobile Suit for that matter. The most difficult area I had on the model was hand painting each rocket! It took a long time to do and this is where I appreciate buying those expensive paint brushes. The cheap ones simply wont do! The kit comes with stickers rather than decals for some of the markings however, I chose to hand paint the markings because stickers eventually come off. The pilot does come only in 1 color which is a light tan color, but he was very easy to paint and looked fantastic once finished. Some pieces are fragile and you must be careful if your inexperienced in building. To simply snap it together and hope it looks good is not the way to go.",toys games,grown up toys,hobbies

"I received the Petsafe fence system yesterday and it took about 6 hours total to install for my yard. I didn't use any fancy machinery, just a flat shovel and some back-breaking hard work. I wanted to keep my dog within the backyard so I ran a single wire around the backyard, pinched it in on the sides and completed the loop by running wire near the front of the house. Setting up the actual system was quite easy. I just hung it on the wall near an outlet and split the wire as it came out my garage. The receiver on the collar looks a little big for my 55 pound dog (German Shorthaired Pointer), but I don't think he minds. Its also nice that the unit takes regular 9-Volt batteries as replacements. Today was the first training day with the system, and boy did the dog jump with his first shock. I felt really bad for him, but he quickly learned to associate the beeping and vibrating of the collar with the painful correction shock. By the end of the day he wouldn't go closer than 4 feet from a white flag - even for a treat or his favorite ball. Actually, at the end of the day I turned the system to beep/vibrate mode only since he is doing so well.

"I have played this game several times and enjoyed each game.To put the game in context:- Each player is a master builder working on the cathedral at Kingsbridge England in the 1100s.- Each turn represents about 10 years and their are 6 turns.- Your goal is to make the greatest contribution to the construction of the cathedral. VPs represent that contribution.Each turn has three major phases:- In the first phase, you allocate your workers to producing various resources. You may also hire craftsmen during the phase.- In the second phase, you allocate your master builder tokens to various tasks and functions. You are limited to three tokens so you must choose wisely. Also the other players are competing for the same tasks and functions.- The third phase is mechanical and represents the actual actions you planned in the first and second phase. Once you learn the game, the third phase resolves very quickly.I really like the way the game captures the feel of the book. Also, for an economic and production game, it plays very quickly once you become familiar with the turn flow. The component are of a very good quality.The only thing I don't care for the randomness in allocating master builder tokens. It makes strategic planning difficult, but that might be an accurate reflection of the medieval world...",toys games,games,unknown

We eventually figured out how to separate these sections using 2 flat head screw drivers. There is a round peg approximately 1 cm that must be lifted out of the hole before you can slide the top sections off. Slipping a LARGE flat-head screwdriver adjacent to either side of the peg, and leveraging it up easily lifts the peg out of the hole.

"Like some of the other reviewers, I did a lot of research before deciding on this food. (Want your eyes opened? Read ""7 Scary Things You Didn't Know about Your Pet's Food."" But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix",pet supplies,cats,food

"I just received my doll and I am still wondering how they measured the 8"". It makes it wingtip to wingtip if you splayed the doll out on a board or stretched the doll out and counted the plastic hang tag. The ad implication was 8"" tall (not wide). In actuality, the doll is 4"" tall from top of head to bottom and almost 6"" if you count head to bottom of the feet. I thought I accidentally ordered the other similar doll (4"" in height), but come to find that there is a confusion on the tag. The tag is HP 004 (this one) but says small Version. The doll IS cute, but not quite what I thought I ordered (Bad on the toy chest for mis-representing the ad on Amazon.com. All I can say is be aware that the doll doesn't match the description and you should just order the ""small version"" and save $10.",toys games,grown up toys,unknown
"After battling with some moderate patellar tendonitis (it flared up once I started playing basketball again) I decided to research online for any type or alleviation. This was a very highly recommended piece or equipment and a low risk option (price is very reasonable, if it didn't work it wouldn't have been a big loss). The strap has been used for multiple 2-4 mile runs with little to no pain post run. I have used it playing basketball with much less pain but there is still some inflammation present so jumping/landing (more so pandit and decelerating) still aggrevate it a few times a game.Overall my functional activity level is almost back to normal. I can walk or run down stairs or hills, make quick lateral movements, and stop and go quickly with no noticeable issues and the neoprene and pressure support seem to keep those surrounding muscles loose so I've yet to experience any post workout soreness or the dull ache in my knee I used to experience.For anyone buying this item you most likely have patellar issues as well. Search ""decline board squats"" as this was an exercise I found about 2 weeks after the straps that has also helped alleviate the tendonitis.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces

"This product is purrrrrrrrrrrfect! It's a moisturizer, sunscreen, and gives you a little color all in one package. Relatively speaking, I wear little make-up so this product is perfect for me. I can wash my face in the morning put just a little Dermalogica sheer tint moisture on, apply some mascara, and lip balm and I'm ready for the day.Dermalogica has created a product that is non-greasy, spf protective, and looks completely natural. So many tinted moisturizers look oily and do not complement my natural complexion. If you've ever struggled with finding a color match with foundation and base I recommend Dermaligica tinted moisturizer. It's not heavy like base and has just enough color to even out your tone. It comes in light, medium, and dark.I have fair olive colored skin and use the light. If I were to tan I'd probably use the medium but I try to avoid the sun to protect my skin from damage and that pesky skin cancer changed my mind about sunbathing.girldiver:)",beauty,skin care,face

"My 4-year old daughter certainly loved playing with this on Christmas morning, but none of the sounds worked after it was assembled. Three sets of new batteries were used to try to get the sounds to work, but to no avail. The people at the Mattel hotline said there was nothing that they could do, that there isn't a part to send to me for replacement. They suggested I take it back to the merchant. But since it's so huge and purchased online, sending it back isn't practical. No complaint against Amazon specifically (they sent a sealed box, ahead of schedule), but purchasing online makes it difficult to take care of defective items. The price on Amazon was the best I saw ($89 and change), but after I purchased it from Amazon, I saw the same price at Toys R Us and Wal-Mart.

I tracked it from Texas to Va and anticipated delivery to WV within a day or two. Imagine my dismay when I saw it two days later back in Texas!! This was a customer service nightmare. Amazon blamed UPS, UPS blamed Amazon. No one was really sympathetic to my plight. It was like ""Oh well, it'll get there sooner or later."" Once it did, the box was in pieces and like I said, it was the antithesis of cheerful plaid. The footrests are really flimsy but other than that, it seems like it will be fine for limited use.

My daughter thought the twirling skirt was neat, but was not sure why just her skirt twirled.Novel in it's idea but somehow I just wish Mattel would stick with making simpler dolls. The Twelve Dancing Princess set is the largest group I have ever seen of novel Barbie Dolls. Somehow I think my daughter would enjoy them more without all the extras Mattel has added to this group. It takes away the magic of imagination with all the theatrics and makes it impossible to use in more than one way. It will be hard on the pocket book if Mattel keeps that up.

"This product came in a 70 or so pound package from my UPS guy. I had to go outside and help him as it is a two man lift box, though not overly heavy, just large and awkward. The product is well insulated however, and despite some dings on the package, the wood was unharmed.The product pieces were all there, and the instructions were simple to understand. The wood is beautiful and of good quality, and everything is assembled by pressure via barrel locks instead of your cheap ass cam locks that normally come with assembled furniture. As a result, the several boneheaded mistakes that I made (make sure on the sides of the headboard the spring holes are facing inwards.... doh) were easy to fix. It can also be disassembled for moving or to move it downstairs, which I will eventually do, without losing intactness or structure. Just make sure you don't overtighten anything, it is a study product without doing so and you will decrease your usability or damage the wood. The mattress spring is pretty low even at it's highest position, and has several more rungs down to go before it outlives it's usefulness. Even then, it can be converted into a toddler bed or a headboard and foot board with some additional parts. It is rather large and safe looking and looks great in our bedroom. It will be bittersweet to move our son from his bassinet to this crib but at least I can do it with confidence.",baby products,nursery,furniture

"This is my first electric toothbrush and I'm no spring chicken so I didn't know what to expect but the Sonicare 9500 is terrific.I like the timer and the 'break-in' feature which keeps those new to this type brush from overdoing it at first. It does a great job overall and my teeth have never been cleaner.Like some other reviewers have pointed out, the ridge between the head and the power unit tend to collect junk which needs to be cleaned periodically (I soak in hydrogen peroxide). Another reviewer has posted a like to a silicon cover for this area which supposedly corrects this but I haven't tried it.The brushes so far have lasted only about 3 months each but I can buy them in 3-packs at Sams for just over $30 so while not cheap, that is not prohibitively expensive either. The fact that the brushes needed to be replaced as frequently as they do is the only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"My mother bought this toy 2 weeks ago for my 5-year old daughter's birthday. She loves the toy so that is a big plus. I don't think she's noticed the little things that don't really work, and she loves that she can make her new wonder fairy fly.For my part it was easy enough to put together but many of the small sprite pieces are too small to really play with around this big playset. Also the attachments for the sprites on the orange flower are impossible to keep in place so don't even try. The fact that the little slide is detachable really just means that it will get lost all the time. The fairies do fly very well, but my daughter can only get her big Barbie in, she needs help with the little fairies. At least with ours the little fairies can't fly by themselves becasue they fly off at the end without a big barbie on the other side to balance them out.The fairies are cute but they can't do very much. The little sprites have very fragile wings and they can't really move, the smaller fairies and mermaids which you must buy seperatly can really only bend at the waist, but they are very cute. The wonder fairies are very pretty, but as you can tell in the box the wings are fabric so they aren't very child friendly, and don't bother to buy the extra outfits because they're impossible to get the velcro closed and even when you can they don't stay that way once your child picks them up. We don't have this problem with regular Barbie outfits so I think these are just too small.Overall the set and having to buy the dolls seperatly is pretty pricey and it's not a very well put together little playset. However if your child loves faries and Barbie they probably won't care about the little things and they'll have a ball making their dolls fly. My daughter now lines up her other Barbies and lets them take turns flying too.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets

Yes, it doesn't stick to the tub like you'd think it would with all the suction cups. However, I don't have a hot tub, I don't have a spa tub, I don't have a jacuzzi. I suffer from a painful muscle disorder, so I wanted something that might help ease the pain. With a little Epsom Salts, which you may use with this, this does the trick. When I first got in the tub, and had to wrestle with the mat to keep it down, I was doubting my purchase, but once I got settled, it was very relaxing and enjoyable. Some reviewers stated that the water doesn't stay hot. It says that in the literature, and I found that if I stay in it for the recommended 15-20 minutes, it stays hot enough.

"I opted to exclusively pump instead of breastfeeding as my son had problems latching on. I rented a hospital-grade pump (the Medela Lactina Select) from a local pharmacy, but it's a huge pump that's inconvenient to drag around with you. This seemed to be a good take-along pump.The upside is that it is easily transported. It does have vibration that helps with stimulation, so it was able to help me get milk supply back when it started to taper off.The downsides is that it's incredibly LOUD. I would not find this something you'd take to a place where you want to be discreet. I also have to watch because sometimes the valve doesn't open and let the milk drain into the bottle, so if it backs up it leaks out. Mine also will only work if I have it plugged in- batteries don't seem to do anything.It does have the option of changing the suction, but it almost feels more like there's only 2 variations, and unless you work your way up to the strongest, it's extremely painful at first. I also found that it's easier if you don't use the silicone insert because it has a hard time creating suction when that's in place. It also took me nearly and hour to use as it's not strong enough to really pull milk out quickly.Overall, it's good if you have another pump that really works and you just need something to get you by in a quick pinch, but if you're going to only use one pump, I'd recommend buying something a little nicer.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding
"I had looked around for a new litter box for my household and had originally been thinking of going with an automatic litter box. With the poor reviews of the littermaid series and the high costs of other automatic boxes ($300+) I was pleasantly surprised when I found the Omega Paw litter box. I was intrigued by the idea, as it seemed like it was essentially the same idea as the Litter Robot, but done manually as opposed to automatically. The difference in price was the biggest component in swaying my decision. With the Omega Paw being about 10% of the cost of the Litter Robot, my decision was easily made. I read the reviews about the box and clasps being a bit flimsy. I have not had my box for terribly long (about a week and a half), but I do have to agree with that. You have to consider, also, that this is only about a $30 investment. I think for the price, it is well worth the investment. To help prevent leakage of litter and the clasps coming out, I have taped the seam of where the top and bottom come together and have also purchased a few screws and bolts to replace the flimsy clasps.The box is so easy to use; I cannot stress that enough. You just turn the box over, a bit further than I expected it needed to be at first, and then roll it back and pull out the drawer and empty into the trash. It takes so much less time than conventionally scooping the litter box, and it also is much much cleaner because you don't have to really touch much. I have three cats and they all use it and started using it right away. My little cat is absolutely fascinated by it and she always comes to watch me when I start to turn the box over. One of my older cats was a bit weary of it at first, and I try not to turn the box to empty it when he is in the room because he's a bit skittish and doesn't like the idea of his litter box moving. If you have cats that are easily spooked, I would maybe suggest not turning it when they can see you doing it. The Omega Paw litter box is truly a great product.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"* This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki flavor Beef Jerky *Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided",grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats

"Very strong looking, but the taste is pretty mellow. It's not as caffeinated as regular French roast coffee (because of the chicory mixed in). I like it black or with condensed milk.With that said $11 is hilariously overpriced for this. Go to any Vietnamese grocer (or maybe even Chinese) and you can find it for around $4-$7. If you don't have a Viet/Chinese grocer then by all means buy it here or from Cafe du Monde themselves.

"It's nice to find the perfect solution in such a simple, inexpensive package.I have two cats and a Tidy Cats Breeze litter box. I clean the box once a day and scoop all the kitty poop into one of these bags which I then throw right into the bathroom trash can. I have a small apartment, so smell is critical! The nifty handles on the bag make it super easy to tightly seal the contents and the light baby-powder smell does the rest! I typically leave the bags in the bathroom for 5-6 days before I take everything out to the trash and there is never, I repeat, NEVER any smell.These are a great option for the cat owner who can't flush their litter box scoops and/or needs to leave a few days worth of nuggets in the house before taking out the trash. Great odor fighting, economical and well made. I imagine these would be great for dog owners too, as I have used them to pick up other messes outside of the box, with my hands through the bag, much like I would use it to keep after a pup outside. The handles would be handy for hanging onto after use.",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills
I had never used Watkins ointment but had a friend who has raved about it for years. For dry and chapped lips I normally use Neosporin lip treatment or Carmex but lately neither item worked. Just recently my lips became so chapped and dry that they actually hurt and I had some serious dryness around my mouth. My friend suggested I get some Watkins. I went online to order it from Amazon but knew that would take at least 2 days since I was out of town. I found out this was sold at Cracker Barrel restaurants. I bought it and applied it before I went to bed and by morning I could tell the difference. My lips cleared up within 2 days. I also applied this ointment to a cut and it definitely soothes the soreness. I have 2 large tins for my home and office and a small tin for my purse.

According to one website, it is ""A distinctive blend of rare gingerlily with citrus, rich florals, sandalwood, musk and blackcurrant"".All I know is that I have never smelled someone else wearing it and it is an absolutely lovely scent.

"I received my reconditioned Braun syncho 7505 two days ago. Someone in my office brought me the package and it was something vibrating inside, I found out that a rubber band was wrapped around the lock button and the unit was on! I was wondering if it vibrated all the way from it's shipping point. The unit definitely was not in near brand new condition as some of the reviewers said. The printing on the back has faded and some blemishes on the rubber bottom near the charging connector. However Braun did provide a new blade and foil. I like the Syncho 7505 because of it's NiMh rechargable battery, which has no recharge memory like the NiCd battery that most other shavers have. I cleaned the whole unit out with alcohol and tried it out. Shaving with it the first time, I accidently scrapped the skin of my adams apple because of this unit is much bulkier than my old Braun Intergral 5414. It did give a closer shave than the 5414 which the battery is dying and can only hold a charge for about 4 shaves.

I purchased these bottles after a friend of mine recommended them to me after using them herself for her baby. I have got to say that my baby has had no cholic or excess gas. I've heard many horror stories about cholic babies and anything that can help cut those chances down I am for. I have used these bottles from day 1 so I couldn't say for sure if these bottles did the job but all I know is my baby is happy with them. The only bad thing I would say is you definitely need at least 8-10 of these bottles unless you want to wash them over and over for each feeding. There are also many parts to these bottles to wash but considering what they do it's well worth it.,baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"I'm a spice addict, I admit it. I keep 3 types of hot spices at work and poor hot sauce or hot pepper powder in my coffee, on my fruit, in everything I eat (except ice cream.... so far).This stuff knocked me out with just very small amounts the first time I tried it. Now I'm slowly working my way through the bottle and loving it.I mostly came to look at these reviews because I was curious where this stuff rates on the scoville scale -One website lists it at 40,000 Scoville (seems way too low to me, though that's compared to Tobasco sauce listed at 2,500 scoville by the same site). That puts it below all the ""Dave's... "" and ""357..."" lines of hot sauces.Just for comparison, most websites list cayenne pepper as 30,000-50,000 scoville, but I can pour large quantities of cayenne pepper powder (trader joe's brand) into my food or eat it raw with no trouble, just a mild burn. And this 100% Pain is WAY BEYOND that. A very small amount of it will make a large bowl of soup almost too hot for me.Also, Original Juan's website lists this stuff in the same category with their ""Da Bomb"" line of salsas, which all have listed measurements of 119,000 scoville upward. That seems far more realistic to me than 40,000 scoville -If you're not sure you can handle this level, try the Pain 85% for a lil more flavor and a lil less heat.

It's out of stock on Amazon so we are receiving a refund instead of an exchange. I am starting to think most of what Fisher Price makes is cheap junk. They won't confirm what their products are made out of and everything seems to come from China. I'll be looking for a better quality crib toy for my little sweetie.

"The dog leash using the index finger instead of the thumb is much easier to use and far less tiring with energetic dogs. When you use the index finger if the dog jumps out or pulls hard it just secures your grip on the retractable leash and on the dog so they don't get any further away from you. The leash grip is comfortable with good traction due to the rubber wrap, and the leash retracts smoothly when the pet is not pulling against it.",pet supplies,dogs,collars

Every time your kid gets a new car, he's racing it on this to see if it's faster than his old cars. This means you can buy a couple cars for a buck each every other month and still get value from the track a year from now.

"Once I began this extraordinary milk, I could not put it down. ""Tuscan Whole Milk"" is so much more than a gripping suspense thriller. Tuscan takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for the Holy Grail of Milk- a Grail totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. A Grail of Milk! With its impeccable whiteness, Tuscan introduces us to aspects and interpretations of milk and cream that I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly, leaving the plastic carton, and time and time again, going online to research Tuscan's milking process - only to find a new world of dairy possibilities opening up for me. And my quest for milk and the answers to questions that the dairy product poses, paralleled, in a sense, the quest of the gallon of milk's main characteristics. What a trip! What a cow!A violent murder is committed in Tuscany. The region's chief dairy farmer, who is also the head of a remarkable secret milk society that has existed since the death of Christ's cow, is found dead and gruesomely positioned on the floor near a milk bucket. In the minutes before he died, this very complex man was able to leave clues for his daughter to follow. The daughter, a brilliant milkmaid, along with a famed US milkman, follow her father's codes and leads, hoping that he will, through his death, finally tell her what he wanted to confide in her while he lived.

"I always loved Strawberry Shortcake while growing up in the 1980s, even though I only had *one* Strawberry Shortcake doll that was missing all of clothes except for her hat and striped stockings. So as I got older I began collecting the older Strawberry Shortcake Dolls (by Kenner) as well as all other products such as lunchboxes, cups, pins, cotton ball containers, etc. So when Bandai reissued the new Strawberry Shortcake a few years ago, I was excited yet disappointed since the new versions of the doll looked nothing like the original ones from the 1970s-1980s. However, I started collecting them too. Then I began to notice a trend. Each week there was a different Strawberry Shortcake doll being sold- the SAME exact doll only wearing a DIFFERENT outfit. It was becoming ridiculous. Orange Blossom, the only Black friend of Strawberry Shortcake, was available in every edition of Strawberry Shortcake until recently. Bandai had a problem with that and Orange Blossom began being excluded a lot from the newer line of dolls. As if young Black girls don't play with Orange Blossom! Eventually, I stopped buying the new Strawberry Shortcake and I have given away to charity most of the newer dolls I had bought (like I said before- it was always the same doll wearing a different outfit). So now I hear Bandai has lost the rights to Strawberry Shortcake and Playmate is issuing the doll. These dolls look like s1uts and are competing for street corners with the Bratz. I don't see these newer Strawberry Shortcake dolls being collectables at all. If you're an SS collector, skip these newer dolls at all costs. I'm telling you, it's not worth it.",toys games,dolls accessories,dolls

"My son is 4.5 and received the Lion King Smartridge for Christmas this year with the Vsmile system. This is his first experience with a video game system. I do not recommend Lion King as a first game even though it is labeled 3-5 years. This is not an accurate label. In Lion King the child must be able to simultaneously control the joystick and enter button to make Simba jump over water and land successfully. He also needs to start from a precise point to avoid landing in the water. This is my son's first experience with a video game system and he has trouble with controlling and coordinating this movement. He also received the Elmo's World (3-5 yrs) and Dora's Fix-it Adventure (4-6 yrs) games. These games are both much easier and more forgiving than Lion King. Dora & Elmo never die, there aren't any lives, and when they need to jump over something the child only needs to push the enter button. For a child inexperienced with video games and a low tolerance for frustration, I would not start with this game. The concepts are easy...but the controls are too challenging. My son loves Lion King so I'm sure eventually he will love this game, but right now Elmo and Dora are much easier for him to control.",toys games,electronics for kids,systems accessories

"I was given a tube of Nutri-cal by a friend to help with my three-legged old lab mix that has cancer. Her appetite was non-existant and she had lost a lot of her weight. She loved the stuff and we went through it quickly. I bought another brand,GNC Pet, and she wouldn't touch it. I ordered more of the Tomlyn brand online, but chose the Senior version, only it was worse than the previous choice. It is so thick, when I put it in her mouth, as she also refused this kind, she gagged. After losing much time and probably more weight, I found the Tomlyn Dog version in the brown tube. The original was in a white tube with a picture of a dog and a cat. This was the same formula as the first tube and she is happily licking it off the spoon again. She also has developed an appetite, so I may get a little more time with her. This probably explains the mixed experiences of the other reviewers.",pet supplies,cats,health supplies

"My husband and I purchased this camera as a birthday gift for my 4-year-old and she was thrilled with it. The design is wonderfully intelligent as it's very easy for her to grip the sides of the camera, which also helps to keep her finger away from the flash. I also think the two viewing holes are ingenious as it's much easier for her to handle than having to squint and use one eye would be.The picture quality isn't really anything to write home about but it does take pretty decent pictures. The flash doesn't work all that well so a room has to be fairly well lit in order for anything to be distinguishable.Using the buttons to looking through the pictures and to delete them as desired is also very easy. My daughter quickly got the hang of it and I often hear her scrolling through them and deleting the ones she doesn't like.Still, I don't expect this to be a professional quality camera and it does the job it's designed to do quite well. My daughter has had a lot of fun with it and it's exciting for her to be able to take her own pictures and then to see them on the computer screen when we download them.",toys games,electronics for kids,cameras camcorders
"It does keep up knee-high socks. But it doesn't do a fantastic job of sticking on things like a low v-neck shirt, bra straps, or shoe straps that slip off. I think the difference is in how much possible movement there is (ie knee-high socks don't tend to move as much as shoe straps, and once the adhesive unsticks once, it doesn't stick much anymore). One tip though, apply adhesive to the fabric then stick it to the skin - not vice versa. Seems to work better that way. Overall I'd recommend it.",beauty,skin care,body

Great product that for anyone. This is no flimsy tissue that falls apart upon use and does not feel like sandpaper. As good as brand names that use virgin hardwood from old growth forests. And they are great for the the environment. These are great compared to brandnames which have regular rolls around 260 sheets or double rolls but are only 400 or 450 sheets. These are 500 sheets and comparable in price. I would recommend anyone give them a try.,health personal care,household supplies,paper plastic
"I needed a tall gate to keep my high-jumping, rescue dog confined to the kitchen during his housebreaking. This gate, although a bit pricey, fits the bill perfectly! It was very easy to install and simple to use. It does not require any permanent attachment to walls or woodwork, and once installed, the frame stays in place. No more having to constantly undo and redo the tension bar to get in or out of a room, or risking your life trying to step over it! If you need something tall, this is definitely the way to go.",baby products,safety,gates doorways

"We were concerned about how we were going to contain our two 90lb Lab mixed dogs in an area away from baby when we needed to. We tried out a few of the (less expensive) plastic pressure mounted gates and the dogs just pummeled over them, plus we had to climb over those gates or take them apart to get through. Buying the Hands Free Gate has been one of the most useful purchases yet! These gates are SUPER sturdy and durable. Even with a very large dog pounding against it, the gate doesn't budge or weaken (and we have two extensions!) Also, the hands free feature has been a lifesaver- literally- no tripping and causing injury while trying to get your leg over a high gate. Don't waste your money on trying other gates- believe me, this will be a truly rewarding investment.",baby products,safety,gates doorways

Perhaps I needed to use it longer, I don't know.For me, it caused acne breakouts on my scalp which continued to get worse. As a result it sort of hurt when I used the comb. Finally I stopped using it and in about 4-5 days my scalp cleared up completely.In general, I have acne prone skin, but I'd never had scalp problems like that before.Also, for me the comb often gave me a slight headache.Questionable product....",beauty,hair care,styling tools

"I'm an adult woman and always have a hard time finding things to fit my ears . . . earplugs, in ear headphones, in ear sound monitors, etc. When we recently moved I came across a box of Mack's earplugs and decided to try them one night when the neighbor's dog started up. They were AMAZING! They fit perfectly and blocked all noise. My husband got up early and went running, came home and took a shower and I wasn't aware of any of it and I am a very light sleeper. I didn't even realize until later that the plugs were ""Kid"" size, but that makes perfect sense. So, in addition to kids, If you are an adult with small ears, try these plugs.The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because it seems you are only guaranteed one use. I tried the same pair a second night and one worked and the other didn't. They are a bit expensive to use just once per pair, so I'm searching for the best price and, for now I use them sparingly.UPDATE",health personal care,baby child care,health care

I gave each about an inch squeeze and one ate it when I put in in her mouth without her consent, while the other was waiting with an open mouth and always wanted seconds. :) I was able to get nutrients and sorely needed calories into the anemic kittens and their situation turned positive quickly, with them gaining weight and their fur filling in. The littlest one was 1.25 lbs and with taking this, eating well and a visit to the vet, she was over two pounds in short order.

To make a long story short, my son's mastered the alphabet at 14 months old (& to think he was 5 wks preemie when he was born) both the upper and lower case letters and all the letter sounds. Also, the main thing that made him extremely excited and interested are the animals behind the letters since he's familiar with all of them. Now at 18 months and with a vocabulary of over a hundred, he's reading the words that he used to know by recognition only.

It will save you time in the long run.Second, don't press the brush against your teeth. It'll rip your gums up. Just let the brush do the work for you rather than trying to ""scrub"" your teeth.Third, it will get nasty if you don't take care of it.

"I needed to replace my 25 year old corner filter when it got damaged during a move. This one is made of plastic so thin that the bottom cracked when I pushed the filter pedestal into the gravel.

If you try to press the air tubing into the center of the riser tube the prongs will break off. As a consequence the air stone floats out of the riser and the filter is useless. The unit should be fitted with a rigid tube attached to the riser such that the air stone can be held in place.Other than the above mentioned quality and design problems, the filter functions as advertised and should be suitable for short term use until a better option becomes available.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters
"Okay, so we have a Corgi that sheds like crazy. (After we got him as a puppy, we were a little surprized and distressed to see this breed pictured on all the products for ""heavy shedding dogs"" at the pet supply store - yikes!) Our review is similar to others... we've tried everything, nothing ever seemed to get it all, it took so long, my dog hated being brushed...all true. But our dog will sit for this brushing time with the FURminator, and SO MUCH undercoat comes out. It honestly seems like it really feels good to him to get rid of all that extra fur, esp during the seasons when he is blowing his coat (spring & fall.)

"The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin is a fabulous mystery novel. It kicks off with select people being invited to live in Sunset Towers on Lake Michigan (Wisconsin). Who are these people? They are parents, children, a dressmaker, a secretary, a doctor, a judge, a doorman, a cleaning lady, and an inventor.

"We had to replace our LitterMaid unit three times over the course of about three years. I think that a lot of the rave reviews on here were written after having the LitterMaid box for a short time. I will agree that in the short run, this was one of the most awesome inventions I had ever encountered. Unfortunately, the longevity of the product is not so awesome. I will break it down for you like this:LitterMaid Box #1) After about a year, the motor died.LitterMaid Box #2) After about a year, the motor died.LitterMaid Box #3) After about a year, the motor died because the tines had somehow caught the wire that connects the rake to the motor and pulled it apart.There were many times that we had to manually clean the box. A lot of times the rake would get stuck and return to its default position, issuing the blinking warning light. Sometimes, the rake would hit a clump of excrement and pop it completely out of the box and onto the floor. The black paw mat that attaches to the front of the box is also a waste of money as it gets covered with sticky litter in a few months. DO NOT purchase the tent. Excrement generates heat and evaporates which causes steam. Over time, this steam builds up on the inside of the tent. The end result is a layer of disgusting film on the inside of the tent which generates a horrific odor.The bottom line on this product is that it is built to last through the warranty period. Perhaps we just got unlucky with three consecutive purchases. However, it is more likely that the LitterMaid corporation is cashing in on an idea rather than a product.I have had cats as family members for over 20 years. My advice to other cat lovers is this",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"I bought this for my now 2 year old when he was 9 months. He never showed much interest in the toy,Then I had twins.It's great for twins because there are two sides so they can play together. That's important for twins because they love to have things they can do together. It is light weight and fits in a corner. It's big but I feel it doesn't take up too much room. It does have some fun stuff on it for babies to do. However, no way is it worth $[...]! I paid $[...] for it and I'm not sure it's even worth that. But I feel like I got my moneys worth because of the twins.So if you have twins I think it's a good investment because one of them is bound to like it.

Also if the camera see bright light then it freezes for a few sec but then its back to normal. It takes quite a few AA batteries but i have never changed then. The range on it is good. I can drive it on the other side of the house and it only has little static. The car is really quite when I drive it.

Automatic cat feeders had broken him of harassment, but he was still fat.The PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball is a godsend. Yes, he still tries to get me to feed him earlier than the scheduled times, but he will also cuddle with me if I start petting him. He loves to push the ball around the house (we have hardwood floors) and always acts really excited when food drops out of the ball. He'll even stop eating to go and check out a noise or see what we are up to. He is more playful than he used to be and seems really happy. He has stopped hissing when we pass by his food and has generally become a nicer cat.I would be happy with just his attitude change, but he has also lost weight! He has always been a large cat, but I was feeding him the recommended servings for a cat half his size and the diet foods didn't do any good.

"I cannot believe how well Toppik works! I think that some of the negative reviews might have been from people who were actually bald. This may not work if you are mostly bald---not really sure since that wasn't my problem; however, if your hair is thin, and you have trouble styling your hair to avoid a bald spot, you will be amazed at how Toppik hides the scalp, making it look like you have much thicker hair. I feel so confident now when I style my hair. It lasts all day; in fact, I got caught in the rain the first day I tried it, but it stayed in. Look at this product as make up for your hair, something you use every day. It's not a miracle substance that will re-grow hair, but when you use it, you'll feel that you look good. This product does what it says it'll do. You may be able to find it locally if you have a beauty supply store near you. I tried the trial size and was so happy with it that I bought a large size.

Under her clothes she has a pink bathing suit painted on so she is never nude. My 3 year old daughter got this toy for Christmas and it was one of her favorite toys. Because she doesn't have prerecorded electronic sayings, my daughter can use her imagination to play with this toy.However, less than two months later, Dora's hair was so severely matted that it was beyond repair. My children do not play roughly with this toy - the only time her hair is slightly touseled is when they are removing clothes or putting new ones on. Dora's hair is currently sticking straight out in all directions and clumping up all over the place. When the hair first started getting matted, we brushed it all out, but less than 24 hours later it was worse than it was before we'd brushed it!

"Our family loves fruitcake and it's our Christmas tradition. We like to vary who we buy from because they're all very good, just different on the fruit to nuts ratio. This year we bought Grandma's from Figis (we found it on Figis internet site). I made sure it was the same cake as sold on Amazon before I wrote this review.The main problem is that we got more cake than fruit and nuts. It was also somewhat dry, probably because of the lack of moist fruit. The cake tastes quite good, but definitely not worth $30 for a good-tasting cake with a little bit of fruit and nuts.

It bothered me at first - I thought they clashed a little bit - but I've gotten used to it, and I'm fine with the overall apperance. Ours did not smell badly, like some of the other reviewers complained of. However, the pieces do come apart very easily. My one-year-old can dismantle it pretty quickly, and actually used it as a teether for the first few days. But as the novelty is wearing off, she's doing that less and less and leaving it intact to play on. It's not too thick but in researching other foam tiles like this one, I didn't find many that were thicker than 1/2 inch. I did find one that was 5/8 inch, but it wasn't as cute as this one.

When a well-meaning nail stylist came to the home to do a manicure the smell from the products was horrific. Two sprays of this stuff and the odor was gone. Amazing. Now I have it in all my bathrooms. (The merchant wasn't so hot - I ordered two bottles but the merchant was out of product and with no notification when the order was placed only delivered the first bottle. Back ordered the other.

The only drawback I have seen is the direction to apply the whole vial of product to one place on the dog, and avoid getting it on the fur. Impossible.

"In general, my cat is pretty indifferent when it comes to store-bought toys. She tends to prefer balls of tinfoil, paper bags, cardboard, etc. The first few days, she was not really into these. Then she saw the way they bounced and rolled on the linoleum kitchen floor and is now completely hooked. She goes totally nuts; smacking into cupboards and rolling all over the floor playing with these. The plastic is stiff enough that they roll well but pliable enough that she can pick it up in her mouth, chew it (she's never broken off a piece to eat), stick her paw through the middle; it's hilarious to watch. They are pretty hardy so even when you inevitably step on them in the dark, they bounce back into shape pretty well. My only complaint is that they only come 3 per pack. If I could buy bulk, I would because there is an entire pack under my refrigerator right now! Every time my kitty gets one stuck under something, she goes nuts trying to get it out, so if I can't get it easily I break out another. They used to sell these at one of the chain pet stores but not anymore. I recommend buying 2 packs at a time cuz they will be under your furniture pretty quickly!",pet supplies,cats,toys

He used to jump up to the kitchen sink, drink from the toilet, try to get a drop from the shower, even though I supplied him a dish of fresh water daily. I thought my sweet cat was neurotic. One day a few weeks ago I saw the petmate fountain in a store and decided to give it a try. Freddie is like a changed cat! He hangs out next to the pet fountain and drinks a lot of water, he's more content and obviously has found his dream of good, clean everfresh water, its a joy to see. I was so impressed I bought a second (jumbo) sized fountain because I travel for 2-4 days sometimes. The water in the jumbo lasts him for 7 days, then I wash the container and the pump and re-fill it. Set up was VERY easy and cleaning it and the little pump is a cinch.

The kids (particularly the 7 year old) have had a ton of fun looking at bugs, everyday objects, etc. The microscope also detaches from the stand so you can aim it inside your ear (or whatever) if you are so inclined.

"I would give this one six stars if I could. My girl's 20 mo's, and in the 2 months we've been playing with this alphabet she's learned an amazing amount. Plus, she LOVES it. She only knows a few of the letters by their actual names, but when she picks up almost every letter here she can state the picture associated with it. So, 'I' isn't 'I,' but ""ice cubes,"" and W is 'watch,' etc. She's never even seen a jellybean, but she screams ""jellybean!"" when she grabs the J. Awesome. It's a great challenge for her little fingers too - her dexterity has improved from initially just slapping the letters down in the approximate region of where they belonged, to lots of twisting and turning to slot each one and now, finally, she can place them correctly about half the time. I love that the letters that could be symmetric, like the Z, aren't, and that the u and n are the same color - it's more interesting this way! Yes, the pictures underneath the letters are unusual... and I'd much rather use this opportunity to teach her what a quail is than have her know only the ubiquitous 'Queen' as her Q-word. I only gave three stars for durability because the letters are not appropriate for chewing upon. They're quite substantial dry, but need to be kept out of little mouths. Just another reason to play with this one together at first.Update. A few years later, we love it as much as before.

"I've been using these in my home for several years now. My wife used to insist on throwing those bleach disk things into the tanks of all our toilets, which caused me to have to replace the flapper valves at least once a year as they got brittle and stiff in the continuous presence of oxidizer in the tank water. I was quite happy when I found this cleaning system at a local store as an alternative. The bleach is added to the water that is sprayed into the standpipe and ends up in the bowl; none of it goes into the tank to ruin the valve, flapper, or other parts.Installation was very simple. You don't even have to shut off the water supply. I did six of them in less than an hour altogether. Replacing the cartridges is simple.I was afraid the cartridges wouldn't last very long, given the number of users in our house (and a number of them small children who tend to use the toilet more often), but even if our highest-use toilet they seem to last three to four months. On our lower-use toilets, I get the blue ones so I can tell when they're running out. The high-use ones gets the bleach cartridges and I just replace them every three months or so. Occasionally I get in to replace one and find it still has a fair bit of material left in it; I just leave those for another month or so until it is all gone, or nearly so.My wife likes these almost as much as I do; she thinks this system works better than the disks you drop in the tank (which makes sense; the cleaner/bleach is concentrated in the bowl where it's needed, not sitting in the tank where some of it will pass through the bowl but most of it will go right down the drain), so we're both happy.",health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning

Plus, since it is smaller, a kid can actually play with it, unlike the larger ones which seem to be best left on the shelf.

It has never irritated his skin or eyes, and he doesn't seem to be bothered with the smell (cats can get to hate some products that smell good for us, but they just stink to them).Also, I have found this shampoo to be a little too concentrate, so I usually dilute a little of it on a cup of warm water - it still makes up for a lot of foam, great cleaning and smell, and lasts for quite a good time!I don't really have a single complain here, this is an excellent product.

Sometimes I move the mobile for her, but it doesn't seem necessary. She's perfectly content when it's stationary.Here are some of the downsides:1) It didn't come with all of the pictures shown :/ We got two sets of the same pictures. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if this is what everyone gets.2) Switching out the pictures is not easy--the holes are small and the cards are not flexible.3) The mounting arm, a huge chunk of plastic, is rather unattractive.

"Long Grain and Wild Rice Pilaf is definitely one of Near East's best carbohydrate dishes, to spice up an evening meal. At Amazon's price for a 12-package carton, moreover, this superb mix (with super saver shipping) would cost at least 30 cents less per box than at our local grocery store. And we do love it.But that's still more than 43 cents per ounce, and a local supermarket now carries a fantastic basmati, wild rice and vegetable medley in 16-ounce packages. The latter costs more than 70% less. Admittedly, Near East's Long Grain & Wild Rice Pilaf tastes better than the basmati and wild rice mix, which does not include any spices.But we can add our own spices. It's hard to argue with the savings. Except for rare occasions, we have switched off Near East to the far less costly brand.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes
"This is the first thing from the Peek-a-block line I have ever been disapointed in. From Fisher Price you expect quality and good value, this is sorely lacking in both. I am regretting having bought one for my neice before trying it out myself.My Daughter opened hers up CHristmas morning. I put it together, and from the start was not impressed. I tried the spinning wheel both ways, and neither seems to work right, and the directions say nothing about how to insert it. The flipping yellow thing is ... frankly stupid. The blocks though are the true let down.2 are hollow partilly see through empty with some stickers. Would it have been too hard to put something in them to at least make a noise? The rest of the blocks just look cheep. Plus several had points and bits from the manufacturing process that I had to take out the dremel and smooth off. These blocks are soo cheep looking compared to the rest, I could put all her blocks together and pick out the yucky ones that came with this wagon.She hasn't hurt herself with the spinning wheel ... but I think I'll just take that off to prevent injury. It doesn't work well at all. The only good feature I found on this wagon is that the handel folds underneth and snaps into place for babies not ready to pull it yet who will play with it stationary.Oh well, least it looked nice in the pictures from christmas when she was opening it, and the blocks can be used with the rest of the peek a block stuff. I feel like I paid too much, and I only paid 17 bucks. If I had paid full price from a retail store this sucker would be going back.",toys games,building toys,stacking blocks

"I bought this hair color wanting to go daring and dramatic for the holidays. It has orange/auburn and pinky purple highlights. Almost a reddish burgundy/ruby. I wear it with amethyst, lilac and plum make up and it goes well with light pink, dark pink, all purples and even red sweaters, tops and dresses! It's very striking. Only thing is my hair was super light brown almost dark blond and it turned out the shade that said very dark brown would turn out. Darker than I wanted and it REALLY DRIED OUT MY HEALTHY HAIR! My hair is light and strawlike with lots of static. I am also afraid it will fade because it was still bleeding a purple/reddish brown when I had rinsed it sufficiently in the shower! Stinky and messy and stung my head but hey I still like it. I just wish it was more bright and vibrant! I also just hope it lasts and does not fade. Fairly even coverage but deposited darker on bangs and the ends of the hair and certain strands. ADDED LATER=This was my favorite red EVER but did not last 3 weeks! It faded super fast!!!

"Update after 1-1/2 years of use. See added comments at the end.We almost bought the Littermaid Mega Elite at a local pet supply store, but decided to check out the Amazon.com reviews first. A good decision, as usual. Clearly, that model was to be avoided. But, based on most other reviews, the LM900 represented an improvement over previous versions and was worth a try.We have had the LM900 for two weeks now and it is working out quite well, so far. The unit seems well designed and solidly built. As mentioned in other reviews, the rake/motor mechanism appears to be strong. The larger of our two cats is a champion mound builder and during his first use he confirmed his credentials by creating a litter filler pile that was higher than the rake mechanism and scattered considerable material into the rake guide rails. Even before the unit went into action, our initial thought was that the device just wasn't intended for the likes of this cat. But, surprise, the rake plowed through the kitty Matterhorn with no balking at all. It properly scooped up all waste in its path and deposited it neatly into the waste receptacle before returning to its resting position to await the next challenge.Both cats have acclimated well to the unit. The older/larger one never hesitated. The smaller/younger one needed to wait a while to see whether it would devour the older cat. When it became clear that there would be no such luck, even the smaller cat complied with our intentions and everything has been going well since.It may be too early to provide a definitive review regarding longer-term performance and reliability but so far, so good. The LM900 is convenient, saves time and does reduce odors. The only negative comment (as noted by others) is that the waste receptacle/cover is tricky to remove and seal without some minor spillage.Added comments:It's been over 1-1/2 years since placing this item into operation. It's still working very well with 3 cats using it. A real testament as to its sturdy and reliable construction. The litter receptacle bin issue still exists. There is no way you're going to remove it without some spillage, so don't agonize over the effort. It is quite heavy when full. And, as long as you have it out, why not just dump its contents into a plastic bag for disposal and return the empty receptacle back to the unit? The bin doesn't wear out or degrade. This saves having to purchase replacement receptacle bins.Therck",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"Hi,I am on the 3rd one of these CD-players in 4 month. My son loves it, it's the first thing he turnes on in the morning and the last toy he turns off at night. That's the only reason why I keep trying. The first of these CD-players played 3 or 4 CD's once each, then it was no longer able to read them. I went back to the store and exchanged it a week after my son got it for his 2nd birthday. The next CD-player started the same problem 2 month after the exchange, first I thought it's the occational scratch on one or two CDs but by the 4th month it didn't read any CD's anymore. The seller told me that they will not exchange the item another time. I think that 4 month for a $69.99 item is a bit stiff. The CD-player comes with no manufacturer's warranty. Otherwise great item, looks great, my son learned to sing tons of songs and talkes about ""lissening to Mozart and Vivaldi"". The CD-player has has an anti shock system but that was never needed in our household. My toddler learned to operate the player in minutes. The other downside is that there is no locking mechanism for the CD compartment, so we had to teach the kid not to touch the CDs.

"This is really the Series 1 shaver (190 model) by Braun; it can be had for under 50 bucks; I had a Series 5 shaver for two months, and the Series 1 was actually a better shaver for me (and the Series 5 costs about $200). It isn't perfect; it needs more power, and certain parts of the face you have to go over a bunch of times for it to work, depending on your beard. If you get one, don't judge it for a couple of weeks as it takes that long for the thing to become as good as it is going to get. The nice thing is you can clean it with hot water. It also comes with a nice brush. There is another Braun Series l (Model 150) that is just as good although it doesn't come with the little brush. That model costs around $40, and I actually prefer it over this one for a couple of trivial reasons, one being when you take the head off and clean it on the cheaper one the head will stand up; on this unit the head falls over because of the design. Also the replacement heads and foil are cheaper on the other unit. You can pay almost as much for a new foil/screen as the whole shaver.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"For our registry, we splurged on the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio. But four months after our daughter was born, she was already cramped and sweating in that pricey mobile throne...Turns out, though nearly all infant carseats (including the Primo Viaggio) set a 20-pound limit, some 70 percent of babies exceed 20 pounds by their first birthday. Fortunately, Graco had just presented the Safeseat, the only seat on the market to hold up to a 30-pound infant.The Safeseat is wildly safe, good-looking, easy to adapt to multiple strollers, and breaks down quickly for cleaning (including machine-washable upholstery). The five-point safety harness is simple to attach and adjustable with one hand. And miraculously, the seat is snug and cushy but roomy enough to grow WITH your newborn, up to a year and beyond.Another fantastic perk of the Safeseat is that it quickly adapts *without a base* to other vehicles -- two clips on its armrests allow a standard lap belt to secure the Safeseat to any car or airline seat. If you travel at ALL, going from plane to taxi to relative's car, the Safeseat is a godsend.

I live near Washington DC right next to Rock Creek, and these awful biters were making it impossible for my kids to play outside---we'd get bit 3-4 times just going from the driveway to our front door every evening.Due to the warmer-than-average spring, I started scattering these granules all throughout my lawn and in every possible crack and intersection of roots that might hold water after a rainfall. Combined with additional birdfeeders and planting marigolds, rosemary, and geraniums, (and dumping out containers filled with water after rain) we haven't seen a single mosquito yet, even after a couple days of 80+ weather in April and May. I usually re-apply every 2 weeks or after a soaking rain, and the 30-oz. size lasted through about a month and a half---so environmentally safe AND cheaper than hiring a company to come and chemically treat several times during the summer.I know the skeeters are out in other areas, and I just bought a jug for my son's daycare because he was sent home covered in bites yesterday.

"Good points:1. Great for lazy people like me. It's so quick and easy that I clean the litterbox every day (and before I got this box you could probably accuse me of being neglectful with how bad I'd let the litterbox get). If I can take the time and effort to clean this box everday, there's not much time and effort involved ;).2. Works just like they say.3. Not much maintainence to it. I have two aroudn 10 lb cats and have had the box for at least two if not three years and I've only ever taken it apart to do a cleaning twice. I know you'd never get away with this little maintainence iwth a littermaid and have it still work. I've only ever fully replaced the litter those two times as well (otherwise I just add litter through the opening). Cause of this I think the weak latches (which do appear weak to me) are really not much of an issue.4. More reliable than a littermaid (cheaper too).5. Not stuck to using the litter they want you to use like the Scoop Free (you can buy whatever litter you and your cats like best).6. saves money on litter as you hardly ever have to replace the litter fully, you just add in more litter (like you are supposed to be able to do with scoop litter).7. Because it is effective scooping and it encourages me to be a better caretaker by making cleaning the litterbox fast and easy, my litterbox has no smell to it (and I don't use scented litter). Well except when my cat just freshly went in it. But the room it is in in general doesn't smell bad at all.Cons:1. It does leak a little (I've never actually seen it leak but it does accumulate enough litter in the room it's in over time for me to think it's not just due to cats tracking litter. so it's not a really big leak but it does leak).2. Don't get this if your cats are really big (my 16 lb cat who passed away before I got this box I'm pretty sure would be very cramped and may have refused to go in it cause of such or some big cats may end up going partially outside. Some big cats will try but not succeed in a small litterbox). And I have the large sized one.3. It takes a lot of space while not having as much space for the cats (see con #2).4. You have to have more space to roll it (basically you have to have access to a strip of area you can roll it on. I have to move mine out a few feet to access this strip).5. Latches are weak. Really not much of an issue since if you follow my suggestions below, you should very rarely have to mess with them anyways.Suggestions for use:1. Don't bother taking off the hood to insert more litter, just put it through the entrance the cats go through. Less chance of breaking hatches and less time involved removing the hood (which honeslty kills a lot of the convenience of the litterbox if you do)2. Don't overfill it. You really don't need much litter in this box, in fact if you use too much it will not scoop as effectively and it will put a lot of loose (unused litter) in the disposal tray. 2-3 inches should be fine (I think there is a fill line and I'd go to it at max, and maybe a little lower).3. When you have the litterbox upside down, bang on the bottom (which should be on top right now) to loosen any clumps that got stuck to the bottom. They should fall right off if you do this (one reason I get away with only ever taking it apart and cleaning it two times in 2-3 years).",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

My hair is natural and the key ingredient in this line is Sodium Hydroxide one of the main ingredients in Perms for black people and when you are natural you do not want that stuff on your hair because it breaks down the protein in our hair. I was so panic stricken and never used this product again. I had to return this shampoo and the conditioner. When my scalp flare up I now just use what I have always used and that is Neutroogena T-Gel shampoo, it too is extremely drying but less drying than the FREE&Clear line.

"This Spiderman movie figure is pretty much just like all the other millions of them available. Pretty much the same in articulation and appearance. True to the movie character 100%. Personally, I do not like the movie adaptation as well as the figures from the Spiderman Classics line-which are more true to the comic book. If it weren't for the popularity and success of the comic book, there would be no movie. However, the nice thing about these figures are the accessories that come with them. This one has a damaged subway car and 4 Doc Ock bendable tentacles to attach to it for Spidey to kick off. The tentacles are too heavy to have them stay in any one particular pose and the pinchers on them get loose quickly and aren't very durable. But, they look good. The special kicking action of the Spiderman figure broke 5 minutes after my son opened it. Which is OK by me because Spiderman figures are a dime a dozen and it doesn't do anything else other than being ""superposeable"". Unless you want a fairly nice and unique accessory to go with other Spiderman figures, this is the way to go. If you use a little imagination, all the accessories ToyBiz has made could be arranged together to resemble a small city block. Otherwise, spend your money on the Spiderman Classics line of figures.",toys games,action toy figures,figures

"This toy claims to be a learning walker, yet the three shapes with colors are incorrect. The corn is on the red, the apple is on the orange, the pumpkin is on the yellow. This is just idiotic! Also, the volume (as is true of most baby toys) is far too loud and sometimes the phone sound gets stuck and repeats until I turn it off. For all that my eight month old will go and push the buttons and seems interested in it for a few minutes, it just isn't educational. It looks fun, with lots of buttons and things to do, but there are some serious flaws you should consider before purchasing. Frustration free packaging is great!",baby products,gear,walkers
"First off, I absolutely swear by the Dr. Brown's bottles. Simple physics tells you that these things WORK! My happy newborn is proof. Somewhere along the line, for some strange reason, the people who make the Dr. Brown's bottles decided the new-style, skinny bottles and redesigned nipple were what worked best and what everyone wanted. I, for one, say ""Go Back! These are not as good as the original wide-mouth bottles.""First complaint, the new nipple style. Why? It doesn't resemble a breast anymore than the old style. Furthermore, my little girl can almost suck the whole nipple in her mouth, lips rubbing the plastic bottle ring. The old style nipple would have my girl sucking on the nipple part and her lips against the ""areola""-part. It seemed to work very well and transition to breast was not a problem. So, why mess with something that works? New nipple-BAD, old nipple-GOOD.Second, the skinny design is a pain, in my opinion. The much larger but shorter older-style bottles were a breeze to clean. Almost any sponge or brush could easily swish inside the cavernous interior. The skinny bottles only take a skinny brush and then spray you with soap suds when the bristles pop out of the narrow mouth of the bottle. Plus the long, skinny vent tube and smaller nipples on the new-style bottle are much harder to clean as well. The only reason I can imagine why they did it was because people thought the short and wide bottles were hard to hold. It doesn't cut it with me, especially since the very popular Avent bottles are similiar in size to the old-style Dr. Brown's. Plus, the old-style rubber vent/gasket would be a nice press-fit into the bottle where the new-style rests on top of the bottle lip. Not as good, IMHO. Tall & skinny-BAD, short & wide-GOOD!There you have it; my opinion. Take it for what it's worth. I prefer the old-style (I'm buying more before they are no longer available) but the new-style FUNCTIONS almost as good as the original, except for the new nipple design. One things for sure, wide or skinny, I will never use another bottle... EVER!Rmpl",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"I bought this pool for my little boy with such high hopes...and it has been a complete disaster from day one. The following is a detailed account of my experience:I set up the pool on a ground tarp in an area of my backyard that was reasonably flat, although probably not perfectly level. It seemed to work out fine, but the next day I noticed that the pool was very lopsided. It was leaning heavily to one side and slopping water out all over the yard. It also appeared to have lost some of its air. I thought the problem could probably be solved if the ground surface was leveled out to some degree. I drained the pool and make a level surface with some plywood and I added extra support beneath it on the side that the pool had been leaning towards. I laid the ground tarp over this and set the pool up again. I had to partially reinflate it to compensate for the lost air, but there didn't appear to be any leaks. I refilled it and the problem appeared to be fixed...we used it the next day. At that time, I did notice one new problem...but I thought it was purely cosmetic",toys games,sports outdoor play,pools water fun

Although I do agree that the wipes do get a little brown at the bottom and dry out if there is only a few left, but i'm sure browning can be avoided by rotating them every few days,not weeks as the manufacturer suggests.Also,in my home since we keep it quite cold there is a lot of condensation in the warmer and if you do not rotate the wipes the condensation collects at the bottom and will cause the bottom wipes to have WAY to much solution on them.

"This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold.

My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too.

He has been to two BMG shows and was thrilled to receive this gift. While not intended for professional musicians--it is a TOY--it has been ideal for his use. I highly recommend it for the fun factor and as a creative outlet.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown

"I originally tried this spray as a hair-regrowth solution. It worked moderately well (I could definitely see an improvement), but I decided it was too messy to use on a regular basis and what hair I did have left wasn't worth the effort. I did discover that it is very effective at reducing scars for small- to medium-sized wounds. I would clean the wound with some alcohol, dab some neosporin (or equivalent), spray the padded part of a band-aid with the Folligen, and then stick on the band-aid. It helped me get rid of a really nasty burn scar from the oven and now I use it regularly for any minor wounds. I can definitely recommend this for anyone who is in the early stages of hair loss or anyone who wants to help reduce scarring in general.",beauty,hair care,hair loss products

"""Hi, I'm JoJo!"" I just want to thank the company that makes this doll. SO many of the other baby toys out there are SOOOO loud! This doll has a very sweet voice. She is so adorable!!! I bought ours from Wal-mart. Not being familiar with the show (it is for my newborn granddaughter), what attracted me to her was her cutest, sweetest voice -- she isn't so loud that you don't mind having your baby next to her when she talks. In fact, she was the only toy in the store (of any that talk or make music) that WASN'T too loud! Now that we have JoJo, we will no doubt be a fan of the other characters, and the TV show, etc. ;o) I don't know what is up with the other (popular) manufacturers, most baby toys are WAY too loud!

"If you like murder mystery games, this one goes far beyond Clue. Be the first to get the correct answers to score the most points. This is a great game for a group of people or for just three. It is similar to Clue in concept but without the board. It is also more involved because you try to discover more information (such as time of day, location, murderer, motive, etc.) Even when it is not your turn, you can pick up information from noticing not only other players questions and answers, but which players are asking and answering. As in Clue, one person announces when they decide they have figured everything out. But, in Alibi, everyone then makes their best guesses and everyone may earn some points. It can be an addictive game and I have yet to find someone who has played that did not like it. It is small enough to be easily carried and interesting enough for any group of people. Also, it can be adapted to different types of players. Use a simpler version with children and a more complicated version with more sophisticated players. If you like games, this would be an excellent addition to your collection.",toys games,games,card games

"We had this duck bath tub from July to November of the same year. We only used it that long because it acquired holes somehow. I'm assuming the holes just came about due to normal wear on the vinyl around the seams. However, while the duck bath tub was in use, it was exactly what we needed. I didn't need to worry about any hard surfaces and the beak of the duck would ""quack"" which was so cute! We even took the duck with us on vacation, it rolled up so nicely and was perfect!I would recommend this bath tub to be used only for vacationing since it really is not very durable in the long run.

"This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life. While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device. All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier. I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example. I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that. Then I just go back to sleep. On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him.It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were. We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too.Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an ""Itzbeen II"" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!

"There are both good and bad things about this Lego set. I feel the good and bad points are about equal.First, the good points. It has 405 pieces of which most are seven different colors and of great quantities. This facilitates the mixture of colored parts.Second, the bad points. It comes in a large bin, which is mostly filled with parts in five plastic bags. These bags are relatively hard for anyone to open. I mostly needed a scissor to do this. After the bags are opened and discarded, the pieces only fill a small portion of the bin. This is good and bad, meaning the bin is very lightweight and deceptive at point of purchase. The good part of this, is additional quantities of parts can be mixed with the initial set. This adds to the weight of the bin. However, simply doubling the set, which I have, only fills the bin slightly further.If you want a good starter set, buy this set.

The first being that they have detracted from the cheapass feel of the game by creating full-color, laminated cards to play with. The other thing they did was take a game that had a great concept and sense of humor, and add a number of cards to average the whole game's humor to a more juvenile level. The final thing they did was create cards that makes the game more mean. There are a number of new cards that you can place in front of a player that significantly handicap that player.I really appreciated the fact that the original game was funny and fun to play whether you were winning or not. This version, while still enjoyable, has now become much more competitive and less funny.",toys games,games,card games
I used to have a favorite snack that you may know of. It consisted of wafers of sugary sesame seeds. While pleasant to eat I didn't like eating all that sugar.

"Well I got my bottle of Curve today along with another couple of colognes on the ""So you'd like to...start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon that I have been purchasing by. With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together.After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me.If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright.

"My family recently adopted a 2 month old kitten and his 1 yr old mom from our local Humane Society. I haven't had cats for many years and forgot how messy a typical litter box can get. The first week they were here we had a small open litter box which meant I had to spend at least 30 mins a day and night scooping the litter then cleaning the floor where the majority of the litter would fall.2 days ago we went to Wal-Mart and bought the Van Ness Enclosed Cat box and it was the best $25 I've ever spent on a pet. The first thing I did when I got home was to put it together the way the instructions said but after reading a review here on Amazon telling us to put the sifter UNDER the active box and not on top, I re-arranged it. This method prevents the sifter from getting clogged and it also saves you money on clumping litter. It works flawlessly! I've cleaned it every morning since I bought it and it only takes me 1 minute and I don't even have to use the scooper.I recommend this product to anyone with a cat or kitten.

My son received these for Christmas and his 1st Birthday. He loves it when he matches up the animals or vehicles and makes them make the sounds. He hasn't mastered it but has more fun with it. And now that he's 2 1/2 he's even more interested in how it works. Although a word of caution. When he was teething he thought these blocks were great to scrape his gums on. Which would have been fine because they are smooth but they have the little rubber dots to contend with. He managed to pop off one and now the ambulance doesn't sound. And he did not swollow the dot (which is easy to have happen). But these are essential cause and effect toys that all children will love. We gave our neice the farm set and she still plays with it daily. Great toy but another little thing to remember with the rubber dots...supervise and count the dots!,toys games,building toys,stacking blocks

"A student of mine found this book in the library and asked me to read it. It was a children's book, and I thought it would take little time. I was actually pleasantly surprised.I know little of children's literature. But the central premise of this book is how the residents of Sunset Towers, a condo unit, are all heirs to a paper fortune left by Mr. Westing, who claims he was murdered. The prize is his fortune to the one that puzzles out the ""whodunit"" set out by his mysterious and cryptic last will. What follows is an engaging set of tricks and traps that call on the reader to (a) pay scrupulous attention to the text, and (b) use logical reasoning skills to solve the mystery. I think, then, this helps young people not only read, but read for comprehension, and compels them to at least try to use brain-power in their own pursuit of ""Who Killed Mr. Westing?""There is a little pyrotechnic violence here and there, and the central premise is indeed a murder. Further, the main point of the book - that material goods are no replacement for intangible ""good things in life"" - can be a little preachy. But it's a children's book, as mentioned, and that's to be expected. Still, parents should be aware of the low-grade violence.A fun and engaging book for the amateur sleuth, an excellent skill-builder, and a great set up to introduce the young reader to the fascinating genre of the murder mystery.Recommended.",toys games,games,unknown

"We were skeptical with the wide variety and range of reviews; and went ahead and purchased. Extremely happy with the quality and durability of the layout, and experienced none of the issues that others mentioned. Track snapped together well, has held up well on carpet circled around the christmas tree, and we have had no issues with random derailing or issues with connecting the cars. My 4 and 8 year old have been playing with it all day.From playing with trains since I was their age, I am familiar with connecting track and how the cars and train should function; and I can see how there is definitely a minor level of mechanical ability required here than may be out of some peoples comfort zone if they have not worked with trains before or may not have a lot of mechanical intuition. And yes, this is plastic and battery operated, not a metal O guage layout; but nevertheless quality and workmanship were everything we expected for the price.

"My husband and I LOVE theTraveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessoryand recommend it to ALL of our friends! After using it to fly cross country last summer with our one-year-old, my husband proclaimed it the best $$ I've ever spent! It was VERY simple to attach and stayed tight to the carry-on.I was surprised at the negative reviews that complain about taking it on and off the luggage or readjusting the LATCH system. One reviewer said it was so hard to put on because you had to lay the suitcase down. Well, if you laid the suitcase down, it would be hard, practically impossible. But it's totally simple! I practiced once in our living room before the flight and voila! We set the carseat level on the ground and backed the suitcase up to it. We then connected the LATCH system to the Traveling Toddler and were off!Our son fell asleep during one leg of flights and my husband simply carried the carseat (with him inside) off the plane and then reattached it to our carry-on. I wheeled him through the airport and right onto the next plane, still sound asleep! Granted, I'm not strong enough to carry him in the carseat off the plane alone, but I'm not scared to travel with it by myself.Looking forward to taking it back cross country (by myself) this year!",baby products,car seats accessories,accessories
"This is a great stroller...Originally I had purchased a joovy, but my 3 year old still likes to sit in the stroller and face forward, so I got this instead and I love it...It is easy to push even one handed which I have had to do many many times. Plus it is not too much bigger than the quatro system which I have used for the past three years.There were a couple of things that I didn't like...First, with a baby seat in the back, it is virtually impossible to get any storage, which I definitely need. Second, my daughter is tall so when I lay the back of the front seat all the way down so my daughter can sleep, her head hits the tray that is used to lock in the car seat. And lastly, you need to angle the car seat to get it in the back. these are all minor issues. Over all I am very happy that I got this stroller and love taking my daughters out in it.",baby products,strollers,tandem

There is only one side of each of the pieces that attaches magnetically to the train's base. So that means you have to try up to 6 surfaces to find the ""sticky"" surface.

My hair feels silky all the way to the ends, stays full and bouncy, and I only wash it every 2-3 days now. To me, this is a miracle! I definitely recommend, will definitely buy again.

This model is very well made. My dog chewed a hole in it and the slide remained inflated without being affected. It would be better if the water flow rate was adjustable. The water is provided by a garden hose and is supplied to the two slides. One tends to get a larger portion of the water flow. I adjusted this using a medical tubing clamp on one hose.

I have put that pair in the kitchen drawer so that my wife and I can use them to read recipes, or baking instructions on the back of products. The new pair that I bought has a 2 piece storage case that should not break in my computer bag.

"We got this book for our then 6 yo son. He loved it, for about 15 minutes. It took no time for it to stop working, the wire connecting the pen frayed quickly. The point on the pen kept falling out, and thats where the wires connect, without it, it won't work. Leap Frog basically told me we were out of luck. This was an expensive paperweight very quickly. The books themselves are poorly made, the spiral binding and thin pages don't work well, pages tear out too easily.

"I bought this for my son when he was nearing 6 months old. It was great for tummy or back time, since whenever he would poke or kick it he was rewarded with music and lights and swimming glittery fish. He would lie on his back and bonk the flutterballs together or wave them in the air to make the fish inside spin. When he started sitting, he loved to take the balls out and roll them around. He is now 10 months old. He still loves the toy. He takes the balls out, puts them back in, takes them out again and tosses them. He played with it even when the batteries wore out. Now he looks inside to see where the music is coming from. He turns the whole bowl upside down and whacks the bottom. It's been very durable and a lot of fun. The dual volumes are very nice, as is the on/off switch. The fish do occasionally get stuck, but nothing that a good whack hasn't been able to solve.

If you lose the pieces to this game you cannot play anymore because you use the pieces to interview characters and to prove (to the board) that you are indeed playing the game. I went to the Hasboro website, but they no longer have the game listed and thus have no place to buy new pawns.

"Got this out of desperation after months of horrible eczema on our 2-year-old. All the lotions we tried would make things better for a few days, then all the rashes and sores under her arms, back of her legs, elbows, etc. would flare right back up. Prescription steroid cream seemed to actually make it worse. After a few days of Florasone on the worst rash patches, with regular lotion everywhere else to keep any new rashes from starting, it actually got better. At the moment, this, combined with Shikai Borage Dry Skin Children's lotion, seems to finally be keeping things under control.

You want to bake them until the bottom of the cookie is a light brown, be sure not to over bake. I knew they would taste good, as even the dry mix was super yummy, not overly sweet, but more buttery and chocolaty tasting.Texture:The texture of these cookies is so light and fluffy; they simply melt in your mouth.

"We tried three other kinds of dog door before we got our first staywell. We've now bought three of them (none of them have broken, we just have several dogs and foster from our animal shelter so we needed various sizes). They keep out drafts and rain much better than the other styles we tried (2 flexible flap doors and one rigid flap) because of the way the panels overlap. They are designed to be installed in a door, and the installation is very simple. Two of our doors are actually installed in our walls instead (a little harder, depending on your siding type, but still doable). The only downside is that the door makes a fairly loud clacking sound when a dog runs through and that makes it take a little longer to train timid dogs.

"Before I bought this, I asked my doctor if she'd ever heard of the brand, pretty much expecting her to say, ""Of course, I use Bluebonnet margarine all the time!"" but, in fact, she was familiar with this supplement and said it'd be perfectly good to take. Like another reviewer here, I noticed that my nighttime foot cramps vanished almost immediately -- though, to balance the picture, that also may have been the case when I was taking Citrical alone. (I take Citrical Calcium + D in addition to Bluebonnet -- too neurotic to rely on any one brand to protect my bones!) The advantage of this formula is how pleasant and easy the liquid is to take compared to the usual horse pills that calcium comes in -- so while the pill-taking feels like a chore, having a spoon or two of this fruity liquid seems more like a treat, which means you'll be less likely to skip a dose. In the back of my mind, I have a little concern over the lack of a ""USP Verified"" mark, which would give some level of assurance that this Bluebonnet stuff does indeed contain what the label says it does. But it seems like an honest product, so until I turn on CNN and see Bluebonnet execs being led off in handcuffs in ""Calcium Crisis 2012,"" I'll keep on taking it.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"This product looks and works as advertised. The mobile worked very well and was very attractive to watch- it definitely kept my baby's attention at times when we wanted him to stay in his crib. The music was mediocre in quality, and didn't seem to sooth my baby. He liked to hit all the buttons on it, so regardless of the music duration, it was always off long before that. The thing I hated the most was the remote. Unless your nursery is the size of a barn, I'm not sure why you would want a remote. It's just another piece of junk that takes AA batteries and clutters up a tabletop. That kind of poor engineering is just a waste of money.I've had this product for 3 years now.

"I bought this cage because I wanted to get my two lovebirds used to being together in the same cage. My lovebirds get plenty of time outside the cage so I didn't mind the size but keeping I wouldn't keep the lovebirds divided all day The cage is way too small for 2 lovebirds; not much space to jump around. It's not as bad if you were to remove the divider. The only other problem I have with the cage itself is I had to use a rubberband to keep the cup doors from opening as my littel lovebirds are cleaver little creatures that figured out how to escape.The cage itself was great quality but there were some disapointments. I had the impression that the large door opens down but it just slides up and it doesn't really stay up. The cups for the water and food are not ordinary cup size. They are a bit smaller so I couldn't reuse my plastic Petco cups from my previous cage. The cups do not come with covers.If i were to buy this product again, I opt for the larger size and probably use it for another type of bird.

I've played with children as young as 4 and had a fine time.Although the rules of the game rely on the player taking a turn until he or she determines that luck is about to run out (at the risk of losing all accumulated points), this can easily be modified (esp. for younger children) so that each player throws the dice in turn and records points.The educational value is in using mathematical skills, and pattern recognition skills, for younger players.This game is very durable, but it would be a sad day indeed if the little pigs were ever lost.

"We gave the Pirate's Hideout to my 7 year old son for Christmas, along with a Playmobil pirate ship, and he still plays with this set on a daily basis. He has spent hours playing pirate, coordinating mock sea battles, capturing the bad guys, putting them in the dungeon, looking for treasure, etc... He also likes to leave them hiding behind the fruit bowl and peeking out of corners in the kitchen! He loves all of the little pieces that came with it like the coins, weapons, and other useful pirate gear. Yes, the pieces are very small so you will need to decide if your child can be responsible for keeping up with it. My son is very detail oriented and particular about things, so it is not a problem. We have had no trouble with anything breaking, and that says a lot since I have heard some intense pirate battles waging!

"This is my favorite litter box. The litter is in the left side, cat jumps in and out and the barrier is high enough that most of the litter stays inside.Any time after that, you roll the box to the right, the dry litter falls into the gated compartment and the clumps sit on the gate until they roll far enough over to fall into the collection bin. Any wet clumps on the bottom can be dislodged with a thump and they fall where they're supposed to.You roll the box to the left and the dry litter settles back on the left side.

"My daughter (2) got this for her birthday. We had a good laugh as her Aunt that gave it to her keeps her house spotless; even before our child we could never claim that skill.I suggest buying an actual small vacuum that works (yard sale) and visiting the dollar store for everything else. The canister style vacuum comes with a small packet of the beanbag chair foam pellets that electrostatically cling to everything. It whirrs and has an ever so faint suction.If you buy it, hot glue the trolley together or you will have to deal with it falling apart and a very frustrated child.As a designer, I don't think this is well thought out. It is difficult to get the vacuum out of the front holder and the holes for the mop and broom don't hold them very well. Then the hooks on the side for the dustpan require it to be facing inside revealing the bottom of the pan. The idea that this is for ""Girls Only"" is 1950's in thinking. I saw one quote about it being a dollar store item. That is not too far from the truth.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play

"This is my favorite electric shaver of the five I own (I love gadgets, and my sisters gave me the same b-day presents, anyways...).It's relatively low-priced for an electric shaver, cuts well-enough that I don't have to shave for ten minutes, the razor covers are more durable (and this is a biggie if you're getting a shaver for a young adult, college student, teen-ager) than those Remington ""thin screens"" which require more delicate use and storage, the hair ""collects"" under the blades rather than dropping freely like the Remingtons, and they're easy to clean and hold a charge very well. I also think the Norelco is easier to use in the sense that you simply can move the shaver in virtually any motion whereas the rectangular shavers pretty much are vertical motion only.The downside to this model is it has no indicator light showing how much charge is left, and it doesn't come with a good carrying case. (I have my father's old hardcase but now they give you a cheapo nylon bag.)I'd recommend this for people with light to moderate beard growth, who don't want to fuss too much with careful storage and who shave while reading or watching TV.

We have no other cat boxes in our home.For under $40, the box was a steal when compared to the Littermaid. We considered a Littermaid, but it was just too expensive for so many fair and poor Amazon reviews. We took a chance on the Omega Paw, and my husband and I haven't been disappointed. There are a few, minor flaws but is it really possible to perfect such an undesirable chore? When you roll the cat box, a small amount of litter falls through the sides. Also, smaller poop and clumped urine falls through the sifter and doesn't get included in the removable scoop. There is always small amounts of poop and clumped urine floating around in the box even after being rolled and cleaned. Other than that, we haven't had any real problems. I wish the box came with a door flap (to keep in smelly poop odors), and we'll have to purchase a rug because plenty of litter can be found outside of the box as with any box.

You can't beat the value there. I took mine a step further and glued most seams (to give it durability and a more seamless look) but even without this model looks great completed. I would also recommend the painting as it adds more realism. All in all, this kit is outstanding.

we have been using this seat saver for 16 months now and it has not ruined our leather seats. Every month I take out the (convertible) car seat and clean seat and re-install to do safety check and the seats are just fine. If your car seat is properly installed there is no way this seat saver will move around.

Mine works fine and the kids slam it pretty hard.I usually have 3 girls and 1 boy here and everyone plays pretty well in there - they love it and use it as a playhouse for tea-parties and hide and seek and just general play. One night I had 3 boys and 1 girl and I was quite surprised the thing didnt tear in 2. They flew around the house at 100 miles an hour terrorizing everything and flipped it over a bunch of times and I would have sworn a couple times it was gonna rip apart but it actually held together. I do have a couple tears now in the walls from when they were really thrashing on it but after reading previous reviews I was kind of expecting that. They are not enough for me to worry about and are not on the seems so no metal is exposed. I don't think it will last more than 6 months here so Im giving it a somewhat lower score on durability but it really all depends on how its played with.PROS - The kids LOVE LOVE LOVE the toy.Cons - Be ready to buy a new one when this one finally bites the dust. 6 months - 1 year I would guess.",toys games,sports outdoor play,play tents tunnels

"I twisted my back recently (ouch!) and this was a lifesaver. Everyone should have this in their drawer.The pain relief act much like Ben-Gay and Tiger-balm, except this one is a patch AND the pungent pepperminty fragrance is not as pervasive.As a patch, this item also has an advantange of not sticking to your clothes, which is the biggest problem I have with Ben-Gay and Tiger-balm.SalonPas takes about 20 minutes to hit its peak effectiveness, and when it does, the cooling pain-killing sensation is unlike any other pain relieving balm or patch.It loses its peak effectiveness after about 1.5 hours and its overall effectivenss after about 7 hours of so, but it still does its job for upto 10 hours.When I was in bed for almost a week with a twisted back, advil and SalonPas was all I needed to recover with minimal pain and discomfort.If you are looking for a great Ben-gay or tiger-balm alternative that won't stick to your clothes, then this is a great option.My only issue with this particular SalonPas was that it was too small (3 patches could fit in one hand).

"This is the sweetest, as opposed to acidic, olive oil produced commercially in Italy. You may be able to find a more precious olive oil (you know the type, comes in a perfume bottle with a price to match) but you won't find a better ""finishing oil"" Used mainly to swirl over a dish of Italian food as a gift to the food, it is not primarily a cooking oil (though you could use it as such). Produced by the Ligurian taggiasca olive which grows near the sea along the coast of the Italian Riviera. To a significant degree olive oil is a product of the climate. Greek olives are darker and more acidic and have a stronger ""olive"" taste, as are sicilian olive oils. Olives are less acidic the milder the climate. French Provenal olives are the sweetest but prohibitively expensive. Choosing olive oil is a tricky business. For instance, Italy sells ore olive oil than it produces. Figure it out. Everything from Spanish olive oil to peanut oils to other stranger Middle Eastern pollutants masquerade as ""pure Italian olive oil."" (Spain, by the way, is the biggest producer of olive oil in Europe and they make some superb extra virgins). But to my taste, this black labeled ROI is the best.

"I bought this collar for my 9 lb. Havapoo and I'm having trouble getting it adjusted properly for him. Though very furry, he's got a tiny neck and the pronged electronic piece is a little heavy. Thus the behavior I get when I put it on him in any location on his neck is that it falls below his neck and I think it's losing contact. Now clearly, this is not the fault of the product as it works just fine (tried it on my leg). However, I would caution owners with very small dogs that it might be difficult to adjust properly. We have an electric fence for our 90 lb. Golden Retriever but you can't fence a 9 lb. and a 90 lb. dog on the same system. Thus we tried this remote. One other very important caution - READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS FIRST! I almost cut through the wire transmitter on the collar when adjusting the length to fit Rocky. Luckily, I didn't. In summary, this collar works fine but for very small dogs, the weight of the receiver may prevent good contact.

She used disposable diapers then and now no longer uses them since my little cousin was born. She told me that she would have rather to use cloth diapers over disposable diapers.

"I purchased this item last year, as a gift. When it was used at the beach, I was extremely disappointed that it was far too difficult to wheel in the sand. We were carrying a baby and some typical beach gear. We tried it both with and without releasing some air from the tires. Be sure to measure your trunk space before purchasing, as it does not fit well into some SUVs and is very heavy. It requires about 1-1/2 hours assembly time, unless you do this kind of thing everyday.I was thinking of purchasing another for normal terrain, but i would like some alternative suggestions, if anyone has any ideas.The low rating was due both to my annoyance at trying to pull it through the sand and the ""so what"" attitude i received when i called the company asking for alternative suggestions.I would be curious to know if the costco item is #29 or the smaller wagon.",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons

"The Smasher RC Destroyer is a nice model of a Russian Souvemanney Missle curser. Remove some of the toy -like items, stick on names ,paint some of the bright silver battleship gray and you have a nice boat. The speed in the water is way to fast even for the real boat. RC batteries in the same size,but in lower voltage range can be purchased that will let this ship run at a nice scale speed. You do not have to use the built in battery charger, batteries can be charged out of the boat then installed. I always recommend atleast 2 fully charged batteries when operating so when one is used you can keep sailing. The Helix helocopter on the flight deck is the wrong scale. Should be removed, it could be replaced with one from the similar Challenger Aircraft Carrier which are the right scale. There is a Child Proof Safety feature,the boat will not run out out of the water like others will. You must have it it the water to run, or use clip lead wires between the the motors to test run out of the water.

"After tiring of taking plastic grocery bags filled with kitty peeps and poops out to the garbage every day, I finally decided to give the litter locker a try. Before it arrived, I was already regretting my itchy buy finger and the purchase thinking that it was really a glorified plastic shopping bag. I mean, after all, I double and triple up on the plastic bags, twist and knot them after a scooping. Really, how much better would this glorified grocery bag be? Boy was I wrong! I cannot believe how the smell in my little closet where I keep the litter box has decreased - and I didn't think it was that bad in the first place!Also, after owning (or being owned) by three cats for several years, cleaning up cat pee, poop, puke, hairballs and even dead rodent gifts didn't even gross me out anymore. I was very, very surprised to find how pleasant it is to not actually have to touch the poops and peeps anymore - another benefit of the litter locker that I wasn't even looking for when I bought it.Finally the litter locker has helped reduce litter scatter in my house. The litter box is in the corner. In essence, enclosed on two sides. But, my cats would jump over the side of the box on the open side scattering litter all over refusing to politely exit at the front of the box where I'd set a litter mat. I now keep the litter locker along the open side the cats would previously jump over forcing them to exit onto the litter mat.Only drawback is now that I'm sold on the litter locker, I need to shell out more money to buy 2 more of the gadgets for the other litter boxes in my house.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking
"I have relatively clear skin, but I started breaking out in college. I've never had huge breakouts that covered my entire face in bumps, just spots around my nose, forehead, and chin. I also have hormonal breakouts and the occasional cystic pimple. So I'd recommend this to people with mild to moderate acne and flareups.I tried this when it first came out because the reviews were so positive, and it worked great for me. Definitely worked better than ProActiv, at a lower price and without the hassle of a monthly bill and getting stuck in an auto-shipment.It doesn't smell bad- not great, but it doesn't smell like you're putting a ton of acne stuff on your face. And I love the two different lotions you get. The day lotion is great, light, and has SPF. The night lotion is heavier and great at zapping zits. The cleanser is gentle but exfoliating. All together, the system works great.I do wish the individual lotions/cleanser were sold separately. It's convenient having them all in a kit, but I ran out of everything at different times. I used up the cleanser first, then the day lotion, then the night lotion. But I had to buy a whole new kit and replace everything, so it seemed a little wasteful. Also, like any acne kit, this can be drying, so you may need another moisturizer, especially in the winter.My skin has calmed down since I first used this, but I'd still recommend this. Try this product first before you call an informercial- of all the acne systems I've used, this one gave me the best results.",beauty,skin care,face

"Knowing how much our three year old would enjoy having a swing set of his own, we searched and finally decided on this set for both the features and the price.We purchased the Verona Swing Set at Toys R Us and attempted to assemble the set this afternoon. We had extreme difficulty in navigating the assembly process due to the incomplete and poorly designed instruction manual.There is no reference as to which side the support bars should be placed, no reference to the bushings for the glider, as well as incomplete instructions in how to attach the slide to the frame.During the frustrating journey of putting together our son's birthday present (the swing set), we also found that we were missing the front leg for the slide and couldn't even complete the ordeal of assembly. It took us over 2 hours to get to this point!!The only way that we were able to figure out how the slide was attached to the frame, was to go online and look at the owner's manual and instructions (the one online was updated 4/2006, the one provided provided stated that it was revised in 11/2005).We had to zoom into the provided picture of the completed set because even the updated manual has no further explanations as to how the link bars are attached to the slide. We finally decided that the link bars must attach parallel to the support bar and the slide affixes ahead of the holes in the support bar, not even with them as we assumed.I sincerely hope that the other reviews are correct in that the product is well worth the frustration of the assembly and that it will last and provide many hours of fun for my son. The only additional downfall is that now I have to order and wait on the missing part, so that my son can actually use his new slide.",toys games,sports outdoor play,gym sets swings

"I rarely review anything I get, but I had to write something on this product. My cat was overweight, not obese, but he probably wasn't too far away from the cut off between the two. He is strictly an indoor cat and middle aged, so he does not get much exercise. He also had a bowl of food out all the time and could eat at will.When he started to get fat a while ago, we switched him to a weight loss formula food. This did not help much, especially with our feed at will system. I switched to feeding him twice a day, but whenever he got the food, he would just garbage it down with his face and paws in the bowl (cat version of binge eating).In a last resort effort to take some pounds off the cat, I decided to buy the SlimCat ball. It is just like a mini version of a hamster ball (as other people have noted). I put his natural, weight management food in the ball and feed him with it twice a day. He figured out how to use it right away, so we only needed the small holes to release the food. The ball is easy to use, made well (it has survived a young kid throwing it down the hall like a play toy), and the cat seems to enjoy pawing at it to get the food out. I like that he has to move around a little - opposed to the old ""face and paws"" in the bowl version of feeding. Also, since he gets very excited every time the ball comes out, before I give it to him I take about 7 or 10 pieces of food and throw them down the hall one at a time. Since he is hungry, he goes chasing after them (my way of making him workout before his meal). Then I shake the ball (which he comes running to now) and give it to him to push around.He has easily lost about 2-3 pounds within a month using the SlimCat/weight management food/and a little added exercise chasing the food down the hall. I highly recommend this system. I bought a second one, fill them both in the morning, and use one as the morning feeding ball and the other one as the evening feeding ball.This ball is worth every penny, especially if you consider the fact that it probably helped save my cat from becoming diabetic (and yes, they can become diabetic).

When we have our second child we will buy the other one that we looked at when we decided on this.MRC 06-21-02,toys games,baby toddler toys,push pull toys

"After searching far and wide for the perfect tent, I purchased this from Amazon for my 18 month old son. He loves it!!! We set it up in his room on rainy days and he crawls in and out of the tunnel over and over again. It is durable and can withstand the rough and tumble play of a toddler. It is also big enough for parents to crawl inside and for your little one to stand up in. The tunnel detaches and folds easily for storage when he becomes tired of it. The trucks, buses, airplanes and cars on the tent gives him the opportunity to learn his vehicles...which every boy loves! Overall, this is a smart buy and the tent can be used indoors or out.",toys games,sports outdoor play,play tents tunnels
"I've used this stroller for a month now, several times each week. It's great! I purchased this as a more-affordable option to the BOB. My son (10 mos) is quite comfortable. The foot muff from our Maclaren fits perfectly, which is a nice bonus for cold days. Just enough storage for keys and emergency baby supplies. Definitely light enough and maneuverable for petite women (I'm 5'0); just note that this is a fixed-wheel model. The adjustable push handle is nice.Assembly was easy. I did not attach the cupholder / parent tray, but it comes with one. Easy to remove front wheel and collapse. I was a bit worried because it seemed to pull to one side after I'd collapsed it for the first time, but removing the front wheel and reversing it seems to have remedied the problem.",baby products,strollers,joggers

"I love this litter because...1. It completely eliminates urine odor. It doesn't smell like a litter box typically does (like clay, urine and feces). Feces do smell right after your cat uses the box, but this goes away. The idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me...it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes, which I don't want. The odor goes away within a few minutes, and I just scoop out feces at the end of the day.2. It is very inexpensive. You only fill the box a small amount, unlike clay litters. I use it along with the Feline Pine Self cleaning litter box, and this is the best value. I only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a YEAR.3. It does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters4. Biodegradable materialsWhat would you rather have, a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week, or an inch of Feline Pine, that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed? I almost want to laugh when I go to people's houses and I see their disgusting clay litter boxes, or see people buying clay litter at the store. Don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment, but doesn't smell and is a better value?I would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like. I purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them, but she ok with the Feline Pine pellets.To those who are saying FP is a ""poor value"" because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same, first of all I have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same. I also don't understand why it is even an issue, considering that FP is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better. Personally I like shopping for cat litter and knowing that I am supporting a good environmentally friendly company, rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals.Note about the price",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

He transforms into a yellow 2009 Chevrolet Camaro that sports black racing stripes. I personally love the vehicle mode. You should not pay more than $20 for Bumblebee, his retail price is ten dollars. Though I have not had durability issues the joints seem a little loose and the figure seems rather fragile, so I would not recommend for young or rough children. He looks great on the shelf in both robot and car mode. He has great articulation and can do several poses.

"Before I post my review, I'll state the following:I've never been to Montreal so I can't compare this to the meat found in an actual Montreal, Quebec deli.This product is from the USA, but at least according to wikipedia it's from an area of the USA that does produce a ""true"" Montreal beef brisket, although the article also implies that some feel that only brisket from Montreal is the ""true"" Montreal beef brisket.Give the two items above, I found this product to be excellent. Smokey without being overpowering, tender and quite fresh despite being sliced and then vacuum sealed. The pepper along the edges of each slice add a bit as well, but again it's far from overpowering. This works well, cold or warm as a sandwich meat, or heated as sliced meat on a plate.Product shipped very fast, and was well packaged. Despite my getting home late and thus the package sitting for nearly 2 hours (I'm single and I couldn't arrange for someone to pick it up for me) it was still quite cold, being packaged in (if memory serves) a styrofoam box with ""blue ice"" (not the actual brand, but something similar, a gelled ""ice"" that is at least in theory reusuable). As currently advertised as of June 2012, it was in (again if memory serves) individual one pound packages and again both pre-sliced and fully cooked. Fat content is fine in my opinion, although I haven't tried making an au-jus with it like apparently one reviewer did when he possibly mistook this for pastrami (he doesn't mention au-jus, but does mention a ""pastrami dip""). The one time I did reheat it though, I didn't see enough ""drippings"" to make anything like an au-jus.Anyway, when I do run out I'm going to consider this product again. It's of fine quality and is shipped very well.",grocery gourmet food,meat seafood,beef

"....though I am sorry to say that it has not cured my MinPin's cataracts (diabetes induced).I can say that these OcluVet drops have helped my dog see better because he rarely runs smack into things like he used to---and I don't mean things that are in front of him that he is used to (i.e. knows where they usually are, like chairs or laundry hampers) but things that someone has recently put in his way. (like a new bag of dog food just brought into the house or a bag of garbage that I've taken out of the can but not taken outside yet)Things that are very close to him he still doesn't see well but his distance/peripheral vision is definitely better than it was before I started the drops. (as if the stops have shrunk the diameter of the cataracts and thinned the thickness of them somewhat)Also, the OcluVet drops may have kept the cataracts from getting worse (bigger and thicker), and thereby leaving him totally blind, as I have been very regimented in applying the drops 3x per day ever since I started using them (and this is my 2nd bottle purchased).They are very expensive for the amount you receive, but they do last a good while--over 2 months for a small dog that only needs 1 drop per eye, 3x a day (any more than one drop just squeezes right out, his eyes are so small)I have had no problems with a leaky bottle, as some people have reported---I just make sure the cap is on tightly and shake the bottle side to side rather than up and down. Also, no problems with too many drops coming out when I squeeze the bottle---I first position the dog, holding his eye open, then turn the bottle upside down over his eye, then very slowly and gently squeeze out one drop.I plan to continue using these drops either as long as I can afford them (and with their price and this economy, who knows how long that will be??) or until they don't seem to be working well enough any more to be worth their price.MEDI-VET ANIMAL HEALTH please take note",pet supplies,dogs,health supplies

"This perfume is absolutely delicious!!! I have read some reviews that say the staying power isnt that long, but Im unsure of that. On my skin, I know it lasted at least 2 hours before I got immune to it. Buuuuuut, on my clothes, I know it has great staying power.

This is one feature that I WISH this massaging cushion had -- heat with movement would be perfect.I love the kneading action, though, even if it is a little rough at times. Mainly, the rough spots just indicate to me where I am holding tension and, as I work through the pain, my back, shoulders and neck no longer feel creaky. My posture seems to be improving as I've become more conscious of how I sit and stand. The rolling action doesn't do much for me -- seems a little weak.

"The creators of this toy obviously put a lot of thought into the design.This toy is on its 3rd child and still looks and feels brand new. My son throws his toys around a lot and it hasn't been damaged at all. He started playing with the shapes when he was about 8 months old, at 11 months he still plays with it every day and he is just starting to try to put the shapes into the holes.Here are a few reasons it is one of our favorites:-The shapes are easy to hold and brightly colored, each shape is a shaker with its own pleasant sound. When we listen to music he often shakes and clacks them together to the music.-Both sides come off easily but not too easily. If I take one side off he puts the shapes in and dump them out or with both sides off it is like a tube for rolling around and various other games. If I put all of the shapes in and close both sides he rolls it around and shakes it in both directions. Occasionally a shape will find its way out through its own hole but they dont all come flying out and the sides stay in tact.-The holes are just right, easy enough to fit the shapes so he can have some success and ""get"" the game.If you are looking for a good non-electronic learning toy I highly recommend this one!",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters

I saw these at a local store (in a long box [12oz], not a tin), & after seeing the picture on the box that showed what the cookies look like, I found it impossible to leave that store without a box of these -- given that they looked to be (& are) a marriage of some ooooooooooh so interesting layers, & in what looked like (& is) a wonderful 'texture', I just *had* to try these...These not only taste phenomenal, but the fascinating mix of crunch-suddenly-tempered-by-the-next-layer-&-then-chocolate-making-its-way-past-the-yumtastic-top-layer-that-has-softened-in-the-mouth-to-a-more-tack-like-texture-&-tastes-incredible-doing-a-tango-with-the-chocolate results in an experience that had me thinking a combination of, ""are you kidding me?!"" -and- ""where have you been all my life?!"" -- how on earth these layers do the magical traversal of textures that they do is perhaps the 8th Wonder of the World -- & all while facilitating a decadent mingling of chocolate & the omg-what-is-it-that-is-combining-to-make-this-magic-happen ingredients (if I didn't know better, I'd think that the manufacturer was 'showing off' ;) ).Well, I wonder no more (though I remain very impressed) -- fascinatingly, & per the ingredient list, part of the 'magic' contributing to the end product's unique form of 'wow' are (crushed, obviously, though possibly ~pulverized into a powder, prior to incorporating into the mix) *CASHEWS* -- the 3rd ingredient listed, after sugar & wheat flour. Additionally, there is some vanilla, honey, & cinnamon (though I don't specifically taste cinnamon, I wouldn't be surprised if that's part of the can't-put-a-finger-on-it-something that is contributing to the interesting taste of the florentine aspect covering the chocolate.A great quality associated with these cookies is that they hold up after being dunked in a hot liquid (as versus many other cookies, which would crumble or otherwise break apart [& additionally, many cookies would absorb so much of the liquid that the original taste of the cookie would be 'lost' -- which doesn't happen when dunking these Chocolate Florentine Lace cookies in a hot liquid (I tried them with some hot chocolate, & it felt like a luxury to be able to not only dunk them for as long as I did, but to dip them in almost all the way, & not have them either fall apart or melt away from the non-dunked portion)]).Lastly, I happened to have learned that it is possible to alter the original crunch factor, such that it becomes a rather interesting (& frankly, even better, for my taste) 'compressive-crunch' (a kind of tempered crunch, & one that takes on a more 'tack-like' aspect, out of the gate) -- after a late night drive back from visiting family, & accidentally leaving an unopened box of these in the car overnight -- & then during the nearly 90 degree next day -- well, after bringing them back inside, & giving them time to acclimate to ambient indoor temperature (& re-solidify whatever had been a bit melted) -- voila! -- Chocolate Florentine Lace 'Redux' (or, as I now think of it, 'Chocolate Florentine Lace Stackers' -- the heat-&-then-melt-a-little-&-then-cool cycle resulted in the individual stacks of cookies annealing to one another slightly, which was interesting to see, but which I remedied quickly, prior to tasting them, & then finding them to be even *more* appealing than their original form -- somehow, the slight melt & then re-solidification rendered the perfect bit of 'compressive-crunch' that ended up making these downright addictive to me).These are gorgeous cookies, with a terrific taste, a fascinating 'crunch factor', & the ability to withstand being dunked in hot liquid -- plus, to boot, they still taste great after being accidentally left in a car while a nearly 90-degree day ends up melting aspects a bit (& yes, they still *looked* like the beautiful florentine confectionary magic that they looked like prior to their 'heat assault' [thereby earning the title 'Bionic Cookie' ;) ]). So, without having intended to do so, I seem to have done a form of inadvertent 'extreme temperature trial', which tested (albeit unintentionally) the 'viability' of these cookies in a high temperature environment -- & if they could speak, they would seem to have said, ~'eh, whatever...' (along with a shrug of their shoulders [if cookies had shoulders, that is ;) ]).They're fantastic!(It would seem to be a given that these would hold up if exposed to an extremely cold environment, but if someone out there would like to send a tin to one of the research stations in Antarctica, & report back, that'd be great... ;) )",grocery gourmet food,gourmet gifts,snack gifts

You only need a very small amount and it is very slippery. It is not going to come off until you wash it off either so a few drops for her pleasure is all that is needed. Use too much and she will feel a very funny sensation until it is washed off. Based on the size of the bottle I might have a lifetime supply because really two drops is plenty. In fact the only slightly negative comment is that it is pretty easy to get more than you want. I guess the fact that it is not a gel or thick makes it a challenge not to drip it all over.

"I don't know how isolated my case is but I found this game very poorly designed. First off the questions are based on the same movies and other Disney related topics over and over again. There isn't nearly enough variety making the game very repetative. Second, some of the cards are miss printed so that the answers don't match the questions. Third, the board was not designed correctly. Like Trivial Pursuit you have to acquire five colors which are red, yellow, purple, green and blue. Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board. This means you can never be asked a &quot;Blue&quot; question, and you can never acquire the five colors to win the game. I was very dissapointed in this shotty product. You would expect quality from Disney. This game is anything but. I would definitely recommend not buying this game and going with the original version.",toys games,games,board games

"I purchased two (2)of these last month and let me say at the outset that I am probably asking for trouble in again purchasing a ""Sea Doo"" product. I purchased two of the predecessor, $200 models and both quit within two months. I sent them back and never got a refund, nor even an answer despite half a dozen emails trying to track down the return (using the UPS receipt)only to find that the then-seller was out of business. Amazon igonored me after the usual ""we're so sorry for the trouble"" email and I was never reimbursed. You'd think I'd learn.But two years later, here I am ordering from ""Leisure Pro"" two of the Explorer model and thinking that with the Sea Doo name (which, by the way is a trademark of Bombardier), the things would work. Neither does.I've been diving for 35 years and am a product liability lawyer with some understanding of how these things work. As far as I can tell, the water senseor is defective in these causing the scooters to go into ""limp home mode"", i.e. 10 seconds ""on"", 60 seconds off. Repeated effort to reseat the cone(actually there wasn't ever water in there) and settling the four conncetors proved useless. So I tried to contact the manufacturer.Surprise! This is not a Bombardier product but rather a Hong Kong company called ""Sea Stallion."" When you call the help line, 877-265-0996, the call immediately goes to ""No one is home, please leave a message."" All times of the day and night.

Several were simply separated into bottom graham section and top marshmallow section, it was so obvious through the unopened clear plastic. Several also had signs of fat bloom which happens when chocolate is not stored under proper temperatures; it looks like a discolored section, generally much lighter than other chocolate. A lot of folks say it doesn't taste different but I think it has a slight grainy texture and a less cocoa flavor.If you like marshmallows, graham cookies, and chocolate, you should check these out but only if you buy them in a store you know will house them properly until you get them. At that point it will be up to you to prevent either fat or sugar bloom.",grocery gourmet food,breads bakery,fresh baked cookies
"I bought this produt Jan of this year and I love it. I am kind of person who does not believe in all this but when I tried I had to believe that there is something which is always supporting me and keeping up with my energy. Before wearing it I would be scared to go to stores like Walmart or Shopping Malls because of how the things smell there and becuase of going there will drain my energy for the rest of the day so if I go to these places either I make a quick run or I will go in the evening so I have only this last thing to do but now since I have this shield with me, I can go anytime of the day and dont feel tired or stressed out at all...this is just one small example there are many of them. I also feel drained when I meet some negative evergy people or when I have argument with my spouse but now I feel stable, not loosing control of myself and more grounded. I am not jewellery person so I cant wear it in my neck all the time so I either keep in my pockets or insert it inside my bra and it works pretty well. I love my shield.

"I have tried a wide variety of pads from premium priced to cheapies. I have two dogs - a small cocker and an 85 lb basset hound mix -- really big guy with a large holding tank. They are crossed trained to go out when possible -- but in middle of night or if I am away all day -- they know its good to go on the pads.This is simply the most absorbent I have found. Others were OK for the cocker. But the big guy has so much in him when he pees -- and these absorb it all and stay awfully dry underneath.Shop around as well -- even these pads have a wide variance in price. I always buy the 75 pack size which is hard to find -- but search -- you will find it.Great pad, excellent overall value.

"I ordered this brace on recommendation from my Doctor. I already had sprained my right ankle slightly last november, and have problems with my right/both knees. I rolled my left ankle after a Physical Therapy session a few months ago, it hit the floor, popped so loud I thought I broke it! A few weeks later, I slowly was getting in my Jeep, not used to it yet as it was a new vehicle and I was driving a truck before, pulled the door shut on the left ankle before I got it in the car door. Needless to say its in bad shape! I alread had a Cam walker boot for my right leg, they put me in another one for my left, and its awful! They wont listen when I say its too big, no support around my ankle/under the ankle bone at all. He wanted me in the boot for another 2 weeks, while this was on order. This brace came in 2-3 days, fast shipping, I put it on, laced it up, and took a few steps and almost cried because I finally had the support I needed! It fits even in my pair of TOMS shoes, which were already a little stretched out from wearing them with the wrap on after it happened and I was swollen. I did put it on with my Nikes last night, that have an arch support in them as well, so it cuts down on room to begin with. It fit GREAT! I went out in my yard and did my gardening last night, which is really uneven ground with holes here and there ( I seem to find and step in every ONE) and it was just great! I am to wear it for my every day use, and I WILL BE! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT! I also found the company that shipped it to be one of the more reasonable prices for it. They didnt charge any shipping. There were cheaper priced ones, that charged so much for shipping, these guys didnt.

I put my son in this Jumper when he was 4 months old with a blanket around him to support his back. I started to put him in it for about 10 minutes at a time. Within a couple of weeks he built up his little muscles so much he would want to be in it longer. He at 5 months sometimes would spend as much as an hour in it. He absolutely LOVES IT. He now at 6 months old still loves it. It gives him the independence he craves and the freedom I occassionally need. It's very portable which allows us to take it to other people's houses to visit. The tray also has a groove around it that he grabs and the extra plastic that goes around the outside prevents pinched fingers when he rams into the door frame when he really gets going. I ended up having to buy a second one when I went back to work for his baby-sitter's house. He uses both of them several times a day.

"I bought this gate for the pressure mounting features.I didn't want to make holes in my walls.I read the great reviews and thought it was worth the pricely investment. Now, I totally agree with the complaints of this gate in some of the reviews about the gate not being so functional. Pressure mounting is fine, but you have to keep spinning the pressure knobs to resecuring it(takes a while and is a pain). It get's to the point where you don't even want to go through the gated area. I bought 2 gates and 1 broke within 2 days using the pressure mounting technique. The screw came off on the inside of the gate. So that gate was a loss. The height of the gate is too high for an adult to step over too. I'd recommend this gate if you want to use the hardware mounting(making holes in your wall) or if you plan on using it in an area that you don't need to get in and out of then pressure mounting is perfect.

"The positive.-This ball seems very durable.-It seems that a larger child 5-10 could effectivly play on it and enjoy it.The negative.-It did not arrive in red (as the color on the picture indicated). It came in purple. This wouldn't be an issue, but I choose this ball specifically because it was red.-It has 'horns' (one for each hand) instead of one singular loop handle (as the picture suggests). These are a little more difficult to jump with (especially for a 2 year old), but could be an extra safety feature for when a child falls (by freeing up the hands faster to support the body).-My child is 2yrs 9mo and he does NOT fit on this ball (eventhough manufactured recommended age is 18mo-3years).Suggestion...

"Rather than write a book here... click ""see all my reviews"" to get my reivew on the 20 tweezer model of Braun epilator. Everything there... applies here, except this one has 40 tweezers.Then... First of all, order this from Drugstore dot com, where the price is less.Second of all... the accessories that supposedly come with this, don't. I don't know why, this is not the first place I have seen the accessories wrong, Drugstore has it wrong, too. You will get the epilator with the massaging head... the EfficiencyPro clip (which I think is useless)... and a shaver head with the attachment to cut your hair to the best length for epilation (which I haven't used yet, so can't comment on...) You won't get the cooling glove or the gentle start head.Now... assuming you were a good girl (or boy) and followed my directions to go to my review on the other epilator... here is a continuation of that. Pretty short and sweet.This thing works GREAT, for pulling hair. It does in fact have twice the tweezers of the other Brauns so yes, it does work faster, and IMO does a more thorough job.The casing is a pretty sparkly blue which, while irrelevant to the performance of the product, is quite pleasing to the eye.But that's about all I can say that is good.The tweezers, rather than being two metal thingies that clamp together (as with the 20 tweezer silk epil), are actually just one metal hicky that clamps against the plastic of the epilator head. It works fine, but I have to wonder about the long term reliability of such a design and wonder why Braun would make it like this.Then, the epilator head is designed so that, if you don't have the massaging head on it (an attachment I find useless and cumbersome) the gears of the head are exposed, which is,of course, an aesthetic matter, but makes the quality of this product seem less than that of the other silk epils.The light, which seems like a good idea, is really just kind of... blinding. It does illuminate the area being epilated, but it does so at the cost of seeing anything else clearly. It has that effect where, you know, if you look at just a little bit of a picture, you can't figure out what the whole picture is? It would be easier to see all your legs in good light than try to see a small portion at a time in great light. Plus if you are moving the epilator in such a fashion that the light is on the other side... IE you are doing the back of your left calve, from the inside, sitting on the floor and moving the epilator sort of down and around to the back... you really can't figure out what you are looking at. It's hard to describe, but the light makes things harder to figure out, not easier - and there is no way to disable the light.I have actually taken the 40 tweezer head and use it on my other silk epil, because I really don't like the light. I use it in the broadest diaylight I can, finding early morning light as the sun comes in our patio door to be especially helpful/horrifying (you are always hairier than you think you are). I think if I had to use the light, if I didn't have the option to use the lightless unit, I would be a lot more unhappy with this product.Anyway it's great in ways but... I am left somehow thinking ""Wow, Braun had a great idea here!"" and ""What the $@%! was Braun thinking here??"" which is kind of odd. They should really just take the 20 tweezer unit and make it have 40 double-metal-thingied tweezers, don't change anything else.OK, the blue sparklies are nice.This is actually sort of a Eurpopean product - if you go to Braun's website, they only have the X'Elle on the European site. I wonder if this model of the X'Elle (there are several other models with various attachments) is a US - only model and is of lesser quality than the others. No way to know for sure but I find it odd that this is the only one for sale in the US (at this time) and the quality is so not in keeping with the other Silk Epils.I am really not sure of giving this 3 or 4 stars... so I will err on the side of generous here. It's not a bad product, but bear in mind its flaws.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"We received our Buster Food Cube about 2 weeks ago. It is made of sturdy hard plastic with a hole in one side. The core can be removed to allow food to be easily loaded into the cube.

We filled the cube with a combination of his normal dry food and a few delicious treats to entice him to keep using it. It took him a few hours to really get the hang of it - I had to show him a few times by batting it around but he quickly caught on to the fact that there is food inside. He uses it every day now like a pro. As some reviewers have mentioned this thing is INCREDIBLY loud if you have hard floors - he also bangs it into walls and doors on occasion which makes a real racket. I would recommend it for carpet only. Overall this is a great toy for keeping your dog occupied and make him work, especially when you're not home.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"Overall, it's great, lots of room, fun toys, BUT...How the heck are you supposed to wash it? The person who designed this obviously does NOT have babies or they would have known to make it easy to clean. You can't take off the nasty pad cover and wash it b/c there is no zipper or velcro or anything, it's sewn on there good. I had slice it down the middle on the back and glue velcro to it, just so I can wash it. I don't feed my baby or give him anything that can spill in there b/c it's just too hard to clean. Also I've had to replace the foam mat b/c it does get dirty. Also the railing is hard to clean. Babies chew and put their mouths all over the edges when they can and the only way I've found to clean it is with soap and sponges and even then it doesn't clean well. I would have rated this better if the bottom mat was washable, I am NOT going to buy a replacement pad for this b/c it was expensive enough all ready!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!",baby products,gear,playards

"I believe that the crane we bought is different from the crane that the other reviewers said fell apart. This crane came with four pieces to assemble - the top of the crane, two pieces that make the tower, and the base. Assembly was easy - four screws - and my 3 year old even helped.Once we were done with that assembly, we started playing immediately. My son worked the two black knobs on the top to raise and lower the claw and then to move it towards and away from the tower. It is a very simple and easy to use setup.He also moved the little person into the elevator on the side of the tower and moved him up and down. He then put the little person in the driver chair. Next, he moved the crane top in a circular motion. He had a lot of fun discovering how it worked.The last thing we did was try out the claw. He had a little bit of a challenge pulling back the black ball to make the claw open. He tried picking up his wooden Thomas but that was too heavy. So then we took the man out of the elevator and he picked that up with the claw. It picked that up just fine, but anything much bigger or heavier we haven't had success with. So I told him that this crane, which we put in with his Thomas wooden set, was there to load lumber and coal into the Thomas cars. It works great for that.It really is nice - I'm a huge fan of wooden toys. My 3 year old likes playing with it and that's what is important. He just gets a little frustrated with the claw.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play

I'm an elementary teacher and my students love this. I like that students are able to check their work and make corrections on their own. I gave this toy 4 stars for educational value because some of the cards aren't very clear about what the students are supposed to do; I have had to explain several of them to my students. I gave the durability 4 stars as well because the buttons that you slide sometimes get stuck and I have had one pop out. Overall I really recommend the Logico Board.,toys games,games,board games

"Got this on sale at Amazon for[...]. Great deal. Both of my kids love it.This toy is packed with lots of little functions not mentioned in the manual. For example, one function sings the ABC song and another says the ABC's in ascending order as you turn the wheel. There are three electronic modes, and the shifter and steering wheel works differently based on the modes.I gave it a 4 star because it was built with lighter plastic, making it easy to tilt over when a small infant (over 25lbs) leans on it. The steering wheel should be padded more for infant comfort. The four supporting wheels should be more padded so it wont' scratch the tile/hardwood floors. The wheels don't move well, so don't expect kids be able to ride it like a tricycle. I put this on a carpet surface and into the Rocker, so my two kids can sit, rock, and play.I wish the manufacturer will spend a few more dollars to use heavier material.",toys games,baby toddler toys,rocking spring ride ons

Anyway, after a washing of the inside and out, most of the smell is gone, it's not as strong anymore. I'm also going to get some adult toy cleaner that was recommended for getting rid of this smell.

I've noticed it doesn't whiten my teeth as much as it did in the beginning but perhaps my teeth are as white as this is going to make them. :) Since I've become used to all the cons of this product, the only things that still bother me about this is how you have to brush for a lot longer to get rid of all the black (maybe that's why my teeth are so much shinier) and how you get black gunk under your gums.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

Apply neutralizer and leave it on 10 mins while making sure hair is lying smooth and flat.5. Rinse for 6 mins and apply deep conditioner for 10 mins then rinse.6. Apply heat protectant and leave in conditioner, dry and flat iron.7. You're DONE! Enjoy your beautiful smooth hair and wait 2 days (at least 48 hours) to wash it.I didn't put enough on 1 spot in the nape area and it's wavy instead of curly now but I can wake up, wash and go with straight hair.

"This product is great but it has some drawbacks which are easily overcome. First the instructions are in multiple languages. This is a positive if you speak spanish or french because the english instructions are missing for some of the steps but they are present in spanish and french. Second, the unit has extra parts... well not really. It has parts for converting the unit later but the instructions for that where missing. I can figure it out with the parts I have and the photos from online but it would have been helpful if I had a complete set of instructions as I will not be using the convertable features for at least a year.

"After entering over 30 manufacturer codes for our Samsung DVD home theater player and spending about 30 minutes on hold waiting for a CS rep, I was told I needed to return the system or purchase a new DVD player that was compatible with this toy!!! I think Leapfrog needs to indicate either on their commercial or in their literature that the consumer should beware of the incompatibility with some dvd players. I'm so sad that my toddler cannot use this after his grandmother gave it to us for Christmas. The worst part is we have already thrown away the packaging and the receipt. IF you happen to purchase a new DVD player, I was told by the second customer service agent to purchase a CHEAP one because the Little Leaps system apparently ""prefers"" more basic dvd players (i.e. Goodwill $5). Also, fyi Little Leaps is essentially a universal remote. The CS rep stated that typically on a universal remote, the packaging indicates that it may/may not be compatible with all tv's, vcr's, etc. However, there is NOTHING to indicate this may be the case with Little Leaps. Therefore, when I called back for my second 30 minute wait for CS, I got a great rep who logged my complaint and request that this information be made known to the public and that their packaging be updated, etc. Also know, if you run into this situation and you happen to have purchased at Target, they'll usually take it back with your driver's license in lieu of a receipt/packaging.

"Apparently Walk-Fit Orthotics may come in different sizes, but they only come in one width. I wear EE shoes (way wider than most women!). I did not at first realize that the Walk Fits were too wide, but I did notice that my feet felt like they were tilting to the outside. I attributed the tilt to the ""Breaking-In Phase."" Of course, the only thing that broke was my alignment (several costly trips to the chiropractor have NOT remediated the situation).When I finally took a closer look (unfortunately, it was a few week later), I realized that the orthotics were actually tilted inside my shoe because they were slightly wider than my shoe. I had a friend with a C width shoe try them on; well, she never acutally got to try them on because they did not even begin to fit inside her shoe. Since the average woman's shoe width is B, most women cannot begin to wear the Walk-fit. Now, they can send it right back for a full refund - minus shipping and handling of course (probably a great money-maker for the company right there).I have heard comments about the difficulty of trying to return products to Walk-Fit. They are true! Maybe a few lucky souls get their money back, but the company just won't do it - they have several reasons why they don't have to. I consider the company to engage in false advertising - the product is not for women, but the infomercials do not say that. I'm going to contact my State's Attorney's Office to report fraudulent practices. I suggest all other unhappy consumers do the same.",health personal care,health care,foot care

For years I used a rotary razer which I liked but could never get as close a shave as I wanted. I also used a Mach razer from time to time. I also hesitated to buy the Braun because of the cost of the razer and cleaning refils but I am completely satisfied. The shave is as close as I think I can get to blade as possible. The difference for me between a blade razer and the Braun is almost unnoticable. The feel on my skin was good as well. Going from a rotary to this type of razer I was worried that my skin would burn and I would have troble getting used to it. That was not the case. The feel was smooth on the first use. NO irritation or burning at all. I have been using the Braun for about 60 days now and would definately buy it again.,health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"I recently conducted a wine study where we had 40 participants drink 10 wine samples of .75oz. We calibrated the AL100 units for each participant and found that the results varied by almost .2 after drinking. Yes, that value is not a typo and yes we allowed up to 30 minutes post-drinking before testing. We even had non-drinking control participants use the device and found that most values indicated the controls were extremely intoxicated (BAC > .2) at the conclusion of a study where they consumed no alcohol. I believe there are many factors that affect the BAC values for the AL100 but none are explicitly stated in the instructions nor would any user be able to attend to them all.So if you are seeking a device to help your child avoid a DWI, I suggest you look elsewhere. If, however, you are looking for a cocktail conversation piece then this unit provides ample coverage.

I researched online for possible remedies and came across the site for B&C Skin Tight. I read several positive reviews, then quickly visited my beauty supply store. I was fortunate to obtain a few sample packets. I tried it and had almost immediate improvement! Within a week, the bumps virtually disappeared! I now use the Razor & Bump Astringent in the morning and the Ingrown Hair & Razor Bump Creme at night. The website says not to be used with the astringent but I've had no problems. In fact, the creme moisturizes because the astringent can be somewhat drying to the skin. When I get a little lax and don't use the products for a few days, the bumps return.

There is a bit more blue in For Audrey and it is a more subtle polish, not as blazing bright as the Essie.When I showed my girlfriends they all wanted me to paint them in this color.

"This gel would be ideal if it were a little thicker and not quite so expensive. I have three cats who all have the feline herpes virus, and I used to use another product and would just put it on their feet and they lick it off, but the manufacturer changed that formulation so I tried Viralys gel. Like I said, if they made it thicker, I could easily slather it on my cats and dispense it to them that way. It's good that this gel is transparent--that way it doesn't stain the carpet if they shake it off. I put a quarter-sized dab on their hindquarters and then they lick it. I recently purchased the L-Lysine powder, for humans (it's a quarter the price of the pet variety) and sprinkle it on their wet food. The downside of using this is that now the cats don't like dry food, and I hate wet food--it's smelly, messy and gives them bad breath. Well, they have to have Lysine somehow so sacrifices have to be made.

"This is a great boat, it goes fast and turns extremely well(almost too well) and has some range. There are some downsides,though. First, the instructions are very badly translated from Chinese or some other language, but are understandable.Another thing, the antenna tube was hidden on the side of the boat and not exactly visible. The antenna tube was hard to get onto the antenna, and snapped after a little bit of bending.Also, when I saw that the boat turned by only using one motor and killing the other, I felt that the boat would make some wide loop.Not so.The boat turns so sharp that it is hard to turn it a little, but if you rapidly tap the button in the direction you want it to go, it should work. The boat has buttons, not sliding control, so when you put it in the water and start it up, it accelerates so fast that you are sprayed with a tide of water.You also have to check on and disconnect the battery after five hours, which can be &uuml;ber inconvenient.All in all, though, it is a great boat and goes extremely fast, worth the money.The concerns above are minor and aren't worried about much.",toys games,hobbies,radio control

One of the great things about these, is that if you offer enough inviting, organic dried animal treats like these - your pup may choose mostly to chew approved-only materials.The one possible downside to offering a puppy dried animal parts like this, is that my chi never would chew on a Kong after getting use to this sort of treat.

"This is delicious, classic Scottish-style porridge, but it took me a few tries to get it right. The microwave method simply doesn't work - you end up with a layer of hardened oats and exploding liquid on top. What is best to do is to use a pan. Boil the water as the package directs (though unless you want it salty, I'd use only a dash of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp.). When you add the porridge, add it into the simmering water bit by bit, whisking throughly during and after. Then simmer as normal with the lid on. This method solved all my problems with the porridge. It made it fluffy, light and truly edible. No more scraping burnt porridge off the bottom of the pan or rushing to break up gluey lumps. Now, I make a batch of this and simply heat it up with a little milk and cinnamon every morning.",grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals

"Just want to give you a little of my hair background...I was suffering from grown out roots and some left over red semi-permanent dye in my hair...basically technicolor hair (eww)! My main color is my natural color-Dark Ash Blonde/Light Ash Brown, then there's Blonde in my bangs and on the side of my head, and Black underneath, plus some residual color left over from experimenting with Red semi-permanent dye.So I decided to dye my hair, all except the Black and some of the Blonde on the side, a Light Ash Brown color to camouflage the exposed roots. This made my natural color golden/brassy :\!! I def wasn't going to have this fixed at a salon because of $$, so I immediately began research on a good color correction shampoo and found Shimmer Lights. I consulted with a friend who's a hair stylist and she, too, recommended this.I washed my hair with this shampoo and after the first rinse I saw some of the residual red color come out-it had been in my hair for six months! It also made the blonde brighter, which was expected. I noticed a slight difference in the brassiness, but not much so I repeated and left the lather on for 5 minutes...still didn't notice much change. After I repeated a Third time for 15 minutes, my hair appeared better with barely any brass tone.I have fine hair and noticed that this shampoo def dries out the hair-I think you're only supposed to use it like once a week. Just much sure you thoroughly condition your hair after this! I didn't buy the matching conditioner-just used a lot of my regular Suave stuff. My hair feels nice now because of the conditioner plus I skipped a day of washing. Also, the smell is kind of nice-it's floraly.I now have used Shimmer Lights a Fourth time to try and achieve my desired tone. My hair looks soooo much better!! I plan on dying it darker for the Fall, but for now I'm satisfied :) I would definitely recommend Shimmer Lights Shampoo to peeps!",beauty,hair care,shampoos

"We've been using this brush for about two months. It is used exclusively for cleaning baby bottles/nipples and milk pump accessories (horns/valves, etc). It is a decent brush, but does not seem to hold up, and we'll need to replace it soon.Having the suction cup bottom is handy, as it allows us to leave it standing next to the sink without worried about it getting contaminated. It seems to work well on the bottles we use (Nuk & Medela 5 oz and straight wall 80cc). The bristles tend to fill the bottles well, and clean them thoroughly. When used on the non-straight-wall bottles, you tend to get sprayed as the bristles flick back to their normal position when pulling the brush out of the bottle. Annoying, but probably going to happen with any bristle-type brush. The smaller brush is handy for getting the inside of the Nuk/Medela nipples, which are too small to fit my fingers into for cleaning.The major downside is that the bristles are already compacting on the larger brush, so it is getting more difficult to use in cleaning the pump horns, and doesn't get the corners of the normal bottles as well as it used to. We'll have to replace it soon, and don't expect the next to last much longer than this one.NOTE",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

If I use it on myself (age not divulged), it's always at least a degree too cool (97.4). If I use it on my older daughter (age 7), it's almost always about a degree too high (99.4). These results are almost without fail, and can be expected if I take all our temperatures one after another, in varying orders or at different times of the day.

"This is definitely a good toy to buy that really keeps my boys' attention. They love the balls and the keyboard and go back to this toy again and again. I only have a few complaints about it (why it only got 3 stars). First of all, the music is really loud even on the low volume setting (my boys have also figured out how to make it go to the high volume setting, which is very loud). I am not usually one to complain about volume, but this one seems louder than many of their other toys. I don't like the music, but my boys do, which is the important thing. The ball storage is a nice feature since I have soooo many balls from the different toys that they have, but the door to the storage area is not real tight and opens when I pick up the toy to put it away, sending the balls wherever. Each ball is supposed to change the function on the toy to music, numbers, colors, shapes, etc, but I have noticed that after a lot of play the toy doesn't always respond correctly (the music ball sometimes changes the setting to numbers, etc). My boys don't mind and it is still educational despite that. My only other complaint about this toy is that the stickers on it have not held up at all. My boys have had this toy for about 6 months and two of the stickers have worn away. Granted, they play with this toy all of the time and it gets abused by two boys, but most of their other toys' stickers have stayed in good condition, even toys that they have had longer or that were handed down to them. It is engaging and will keep their attention, so I do recommend it if none of the complaints are an issue for you.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets
"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well.

"GABA Calm works well for me. I do not use it every day, but typically rely upon it to help me wind down after a fun-filled day of stress when I'm forced to drive in crazy traffic on one of the more dangerous highways in the Western U.S., be on time to appointments, work with and for people who are impossible to please and stop by a crowded grocery store before making the long commute home on the same dangerous highway (typically after dark, which makes for a more nerve-wracking experience). After a day like this, no matter how physically and emotionally exhausted I may feel, it takes at least three hours for me to ""wind down"" enough to even think about falling asleep. This is often less than optimal, particularly when I arrive home at 11 PM and am expected to be showered, wide awake and fully functional by 8 AM. After days like I've described, six hours or less of sleep is simply not enough recovery time. I'm ragged, weary and occasionally even surly all day.Using GABA Calm cuts my ""wind down time"" to half or a third of this average. Because it is made for sub-lingual use, it works quite rapidly. I've taken to carrying a few in a pill fob as ""back up"", so I can put one under my tongue about 30 minutes before arriving back at the farm and already be starting to ""chill"" as I park. One tablet effects me sufficiently that it seems best to be off the road before the full effect kicks in. The Peppermint is refreshing; tastes good. I like the sub-lingual delivery, although anyone using this often might find a bit of irritation under the tongue developing and may choose to move it between gums and cheek to avoid any soreness. With this delivery method, it is very difficult to formulate any pill (or extract or hard candy, for that matter) that can be used every single day, multiple times per day and avoid irritation inside one's mouth.GABA Calm also helps significantly reduce irritability (fast!) in a friend who has issues with moderate to severe chronic pain who's sometimes a bit temperamental and has difficulty getting a good night's rest. In my friend's case, a full-spectrum B-vitamin supplement plus vitamin D and Calcium are added to the mix. We've both noticed it improves feelings of well-being that seem to stick around the next day. GABA Calm works.

"The three Turkish Angoras in my house think these tunnels are ""the bomb"". We have hooked three of them together and the feline ""children"" love to run through the tunnels and pop out of the other end and pounce on unsuspecting siblings or human parents. The felines also like to run across the top the tunnel, sort of trampoline style. I don't know if all cats will do that though, my ""kids"" are little (5, 7 and 8 pounds). They also enjoy attacking the furry balls that are attached to the interior with string. We frequently find the tunnel rolling along the floor as the play with the interior balls. We have had this product for 4 years and the ""kids"" have not lost interest in their toy yet.On the down side the tunnels are a problem to clean on the inside. The only thing that I have found to get the cat hair out of the inside is the vacuum cleaner. If you don't own a canister vac, I would try a damp sponge. The exterior of the tunnel is nylon and can be wiped clean if it gets soiled.Cleaning issue aside since cats rule in my home we give this product three paws up.Feline recommended and mommy approved.",pet supplies,cats,beds furniture

"I bought this shaver a while ago, but I wanted to wait at least a month before writing my review, since it's supposed to take about that long before your face is used to an electric razor.This is my first electric, and I was concerned going into it. I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.The Pros:- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.The Cons:- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"I recently purchased Hanae Mori ""Red Butterfly"" Parfum. Although I have only had it in my possession for 2 months, I have been familiar with this fragrance (although not in this concentration) for about 5-6 years. Every now and again, I start to yearn for a new scent. When I selected my last one, HM Butterfly was a strong contender, but it did not make the final cut. It stayed in my memory, however, and finally made it home.Hanae Mori is a strong scent. It is *very* sweet. In fact, it is so sweet that it helps me to curb my overactive sweet tooth. I cannot overdo the cookie dough anymore without feeling quite ill. Despite being rather complex, it does not smell too ""perfumey."" It is suitable for my age (38) and my temperament. I doubt I will wear it for the rest of my life, but it is what I need right now.HM is very feminine without being flowery. As others have noted it does give the impression of vanilla, but if you sniff a little closer it becomes obvious that what you are smelling is sweet almond. There is something a bit tropical in the perfume also -- I think it is the jasmine which translates to my nose as pineapple in this fragrance. It is buttery and creamy with a bit of a fruity punch. The sandalwood contained leaves a nice seductive drydown without being too musky (although I have nothing against a good musk).I would recommend this scent for girly girls or for women, like me, who need a little boost of femininity in their lives. My man likes the fragrance, and I find that it gives more than a subtle boost to my libido. I could not ask for much more. :()",beauty,fragrance,women s

"I do not understand the negative reviews. I have used this tub since my daughter was able to take a tub bath at week 2. Babies should always be supervised and for not one minute should a parent's eyes be taken off their baby while in ANY tub. I have not had any problems with my baby's foot or toes getting stuck. After reading some of the reviews I tried to stick a finger in the areas where other baby's feet and getting stuck. One thing to note is the areas that fold lock into place when opened. They can only be closed by moving two areas on the underside of the tub so there is no chance of a those two areas on each side of the tub collapsing up. They &quot;click&quot; into place when opened. I also could not get my finger through any areas where water can flow through. I always keep one hand on my baby and use the other free hand to bathe her. Now with any tub an infant (and any young child), could have a serious accident if not supervised. One strong point about this tub is you can drain it while baby is still in there to get the soapy water out and clean water in. I refill her tub by having the tub set far back in the tub and using a pitcher to fill it back up. Now this tub does not need much water and the complaints about it not holding enough water are silly. A baby does not need to be neck high in water. This is plain dangerous. At the young age when baby cannot sit up it is not play time in any tub. Be a careful parent and you will not have problems with this or any tub. I happen to be very pleased with this tub. Also on a side-note with a baby having his or hers legs resting on the little ledge a parent can easily clean the private areas without having to lift baby up to do so. I recommend this tub to all new parents. Works great on the counter until baby gets too big then I suggest putting this tub in the bathtub. Thanks Safety 1st for such a good tub!",baby products,safety,bathroom safety

But it still interests him. And as a Mom, I really like how it is so colorful and that there are animals behind the doors.

"I just got a LeapPad Pink on November 12th and I love it! I have a Quantum Pad too and I have 10 books between the 2 systems.

"I use the same shampoo and conditioner five days a week (I don't wash my hair every day because I have a super dry scalp and it gets tight and itchy). But after a few weeks of this, my hair starts to look dull. Not even a generous dollop of conditioner can make the shine come back. After five weeks, the bounce was gone and my hair was looking noticeably thinner, why did I wait five weeks? Because I'm lazy and once I get into the shower, the hot water is so relaxing, it's a stretch to remember to wash my hair, much less, use an alternate shampoo. Plus, this yukking of my hair is a gradual process, so it wasn't until three months had passed that I was trying to style my hair and threw my hands up in annoyance, my hair looked awful and was limp as a used tissue, worse, I wasn't sure what I could do to fix it!That's when I realized I probably had shampoo buildup, so I rushed out to buy a bottle of Avalon Organics Lemon Shampoo (someone had used all the shampoo, refilled the bottle with water and left it on the shower shelf, the nasty little such and such!) anyways, my usual store was out, all they had was Avalon Lavender Shampoo, I loathe the smell of lavender, plus it gives me a nasty headache/itchy throat/ watery eyes, so I came online to buy it on Amazon. Oh the waiting was terrible, but not too long, just a couple of days, Yay!It had been such a long time since I used the Lemon shampoo, that I'd forgotten how nice the smell was.But I don't buy this for the natural lemon scent, although I do have a problem with perfumes, so I usually buy unscented everything, even trash bags.I buy this shampoo because with just one wash it made my hair shiny and swingy again. My hair is dark, almost black and when it got shampoo buildup, the color started to turn kind of ash-y and stringy. But after one wash it looked normal again and it felt nice too, smooth, shiny and running my fingers through it wasn't a snagworthy event.I've used the shampoo two days in a row, and on the second day, my hair looks and feels even better. I didn't even style it or dry it, I gathered it into a ponytail because I was running late (like usual) and stuffed it under a bicycle helmet and three hours later it wasn't even frizzy.I'm not planning on using this shampoo every day, probably just once every six or seven washes to keep my hair from getting so manky and unmanageable.",beauty,hair care,shampoos

The top clip is not difficult for me to use but my daughter hasn't figured it out yet - which is the way I want it. I've also used it as a booster and I was satisfied with the way the buckle looped through and stayed in place. I also like the strap on the bottom that allows me to add a little slack or tighten it a little. I think that's a really important feature - especially in this season when my kid may be wearing a jacket one day and none the next and also if you use the car seat for different kids that are similar but not exactly the same size. I have another car seat without that and I find that sometimes I can't get it closed because it's too tight and sometimes there's too much slack.,baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

"We have a long-haired chihuahua who is very curious about the outside world during car rides. He used to run back and forth between the driver's lap and the passenger seat, trying to get a peak out the window. His favorite was using the driver's left leg as a booster to look out the window. He whined the first two car rides for a little bit but settled down quickly and now jumps into the car seat as soon as we put him in the car. We also put a few seat cushions under the seat to boost it up a little higher and put a blanket in the seat so he's got more height and warmth. This is a great car seat for a reasonable price.

He will spend hours putting it all together and then brings in his Hot Wheels and other toys to join in the fun. The only downside is that the power pack doesn't work real great. The button is hard to push so he rarely uses it. Sometimes we have to help him pop the pieces apart but its worth it because whatever he builds doesn't just fall apart.

"I love the look of curly eyelashes--it makes my eyes look super-big and glam, like I'm wearing false lashes, plus it gives my face an instant lift.My previous method for curling my lashes was to simply hit my metal eyelash curlerShiseido The Makeup Eyelash Curlerwith a shot of hot air from my hair dryer and that did the trick.However, it's not always convenient to carry around a hair dryer just to heat your metal eyelash curler. With my busy schedule, sometimes I'm forced to apply my make-up wherever I can, which turns out is not always in front my vanity or in my bathroom next to my hair dryer, or even near an electrical outlet.So, I was so psyched to find out they made electric eyelash curlers!!! What a neat invention, I thought.My first electric eyelash curler was much like this one:Talika Heated Eyelash Curler 1 ea.However, the brand I had didn't really get hot enough for a strong, long lasting curl. Plus, the casing of the curler was rather shabby, and finally it just went dead (at a rather inopportune time might I add, while I was at a resort and couldn't buy another one and of course had left my old manual one behind--ugh!).After that horrid disappointment, having suffered an entire romantic holiday sans curled lashes due to an electric eyelash curler I couldn't depend on, I went back to using the hairdryer-on-metal method. I figured at least it couldn't break on me at the worst time possible.But in my heart I often wondered...was there a good electric eyelash curler out there?Then I saw this heated eyelash curler, and I thought maybe they had improved the tool. Furthermore, I read some reviews that the curler got really hot, which I thought would overcome one of the problems of my previous curler.However, I was sorely disappointed with this curler.It is shaped exactly like a mascara wand. Yes, it gets hot, but the whole concept is messed up. You have to manually sit there and push on your lash line, and then you have to keep going over the lash to warm it up enough to make it pliable, and then you have to keep holding it down, holding it down, holding it down....oh Lord have mercy it's all just too much trouble. And the curl really doesn't lock in, because the curler provides no tension or crimping, and you really need the tension of the two hot metal surfaces squeezing the eyelash.The concept is just off and faulty. I kept the product because I really didn't have time to fool with sending it back and all that. So it just sits in my make-up drawer because I hate to throw something away that I spent money on. I figure maybe I'll find a use for it one day, like to heat up some tiny object that is I don't know what.And in case you are wondering, yeah, I'm back to the hairdryer-on-metal curler method again, IF I'm fortunate enough to be by an outlet. If not, I go without curled lashes (ain't it a shame).I saw Panasonic makes a more traditional-type electric lash curler, like the first one I hadPanasonic EH2331P Heated Eyelash Curler. I might try it again, but I'll admit I'm a bit gun shy, having been burnt (no pun intended) in the past.So I ask the cosmetics universe",beauty,tools accessories,makeup brushes tools
"My orthopedic surgeon told me he has had a lot of success with this particular product and for me to start taking it. While reviewing the product description and trying to find information on the ingredients I saw KidIdaho's review and his remark about the Titanium Dioxide as well as the link to view the California Proposition 65 Warning, which entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels. I did an internet search hoping to view the actual product label which I found on the NOW website, but was unable to see where this product contained the Titanium Dioxide.

However, at first glance he thought it wasn't going to produce enough lettuce for the huge salads he likes to eat and he said he wished I had bought herbs instead like we did last time. So far we've harvested twice and the taste of the lettuce has been lovely. The first harvest was small, enough to decorate the side of two plates. The second salad was much larger, enough for two American style side salad plates. The chef pack comes with enough pods to grow an Aerogarden full of lettuce twice.

"I was skeptical about the vacuum feature, but it actually works quite well, capturing nearly all of the clippings. Naturally, a few veer off at odd angles. It has very good blades, too. I think the guide/comb part could be better. I don't really see that the spring and hinge arrangement is very useful, and without it the trimmer might be less bulky and feel more secure.

"I purchased this toy for less than half the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Which is about what I think is a fair price for it. After I purchased it, I read the reviews on here, so I had already heard that there were issues, which I knew we could take care of. The oven handle popped off the first day. My children (boys age 4.5 yr and 2.5 yr) figured out that they can pop the door open if they remove the sink and reach in. Their 7 month old sister can stand at the kitchen and play too, when they let her, that is. The youngest boy loves to unscrew the handles all the way out and then put them back in.We now have screws for the oven handle and will be fixing that. I am not sure if we will be screwing down the faucet, but I am sure we are not screwing down the bar with hooks. I am not fond of that bar, I fear someone is going to get hurt on those hooks.Overall the size is very nice for homes with limited space, especially since it has an oven, sink and two burners.I do think the manufacturer could do a better job, especially since I couldn't find anywhere on the box that the dishes are not included, and I looked.My children deemed this the best toy from Christmas.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play
"I purchased this item as a gift for my seventeen month-old niece on the strength of its reviews and I was not disappointed. Just like the other reviews, my niece could not put this toy down - even when enticed with other gifts on Christmas day (although a large empty cardboard did momentarily occupy her interest). Short of suspecting the manufacturer with coating the toy with come kind of skin-contact narcotic, I believe that this is an ideal gift for toddlers.Nevertheless, I see an awful lot of the later versions of this toy (meant for slightly older children) at the secondary level stores such as Marshalls for more than half off as well as in thrift stores for around $10 still ""new-in-box"" so perhaps it's really only good for children that still aren't capable of forming coherent sentences (much less words).",toys games,electronics for kids,electronic toys

I bought this brush because some reviews said it was good for sensitive skin and wouldn't hurt. I disagree whole-heartedly. Poor pup looks so sad when I pull the brush out and he really acts like it hurts when I brush more sensitive areas like his legs. I pulled the brush across my own skin and it left scratches when I didn't even brush hard.I will continue to use this brush because it does work really well.

I let him build the projects himself, but I don't let him connect the battery until I check over the circuit just in case he created a short. The kit allows for creative thinking as well. For example, in one project, the audio was too loud. I suggested to my kid that he put a resistor (provided with kit) in-line with the speaker. He was thrilled when it worked.

"This was my first Tourmaline hair dryer. So I can't compare it with anything. I have thick middle-eastern hair that gets frizzy when I blow-dry it. But I was very happy with this dryer until the fan stopped working after 10 months gentle use (twice a week).Pros:----------- It gets very hot (you can burn your hand if you touch your hair after drying it with this dryer). So it dries hair very fast.- It's light-weight.- It was much quieter than my previous Revlon dryer, before the fan started making loud noises.- It left my hair silky and very soft.Cons:----------- Stopped working after 10 months gentle use (at most twice a week)!- It's too long to use with the diffuser attachment on your own hair, unless you have very long arms!- The heat melted the concentrator attachment after a few months. Hopefully it didn't ruin my hair.- Due to its length, it's hard to fit into your suitcase; something you might want to consider if you travel a lot like I do.Over all, I won't buy this again.

I loved the photos of these cat toys; the colors were bright and cheerful and the springs 'looked springy and fun'. I admit I stopped reading after reading just a few reviews about how much other people's cats loved these toys. The springs sounded exactly like something my two cats would be in love with.Now I now don't know if they would like them or not because I would never let them play with them. The are way too stiff for even me to 'spring' them. The colors are very unattractive. The paint looks ugly and smells horrid. They are very hard metal with extremely sharp and painful pointed ends on each end that could stab a paw or tongue or spring into an eye or other body part and could really injure you if you accidentally stepped on one. The photo is entirely misleading. Now, finally reading reviews after the fact, I read that this toy indeed 'used' to actually be like it looks in the photos; bright, cheery, soft plastic, springy. etc.If you love your cats and your cats love to have fun with interactive, but safe, toys, I would not recommend buying these. I am not at all interested in reporting whether my pets like them or not; I love my two cats way too much to let them get their little paws on even one of these dangerous springs.Wouldn't pay to send them back, but definitely won't use them or, heaven forbid, ever order anymore.EDIT",pet supplies,cats,toys

It would be more user-friendly if there was a zipper or door to access this area - it would be great for storing blankets, diapers, etc. Also, if you purchase the canopy to cover the co-sleeper, be aware that there is only one zipper opening which makes it difficult to get baby in and out of the co-sleeper during the day (depending on which direction the zipper faces if the co-sleeper is used as directed up against the bed).",baby products,nursery,furniture

"This works excellent! And almost instantaneously! I've been getting horrible dark circles under my eyes all my life, since I was 2. I always had problems with them and little worked before. I notice an instant difference with this. I'll usually just put a bunch on after I wake up in the morning if they are bad and let it sink in. Keep applying a few times within the next half hour every 10 mins or so, and they are pretty much gone. Don't even need to use it all the time. If I use it at least every few days, no problems. At the very worst, the circles are gone in 2 days. It works amazing. Makes me wonder what is in it actually that it works so well. It also gets rid of puffiness and feels a nice refreshing tingle after putting on. I was surprised, as I am always let down by these beauty products never really doing what they claim to do. Also, if you have the same problem as I, it's good to get enough B vitamins and eat/sleep well. Hope this helps! I hope more people start using this section of Amazon and rating. It's wonderful not to always have to go by trial and error!-------------Update. April 2005.-------------------------I just wanted to add an update to help other people who have problems with dark circles. I also have allergies, which I have found out is part of what is causing them. These are pet allergies, dust, and food allergies (allergies to food toxins and especially dairy.. my immune system attacks the animal proteins in dairy and give me cold-like symptoms). I try to almost never eat white sugar and to eat organic, healthy food as much as I can now, and have stopped eating dairy completely. My problem with the dark circles has almost completely gone away on its own now naturally. This has plaqued me all my life and I never knew how poisonous regular sugar, dairy and some other foods were! My health has improved in other ways, too. I wish someone would have clued me in long ago, so I thought I would share! I'm sure anyone with the same problem would be glad to be rid of it.Dark circles can also signify kidney or liver problems I have found. So make sure your body is properly filtering toxins and do a kidney cleanse, and drink lots of pure water, and get lots of vitamins and vitamin C! If you have dark circles, that basically signals something to do with your health. Maybe our immune systems are more sensitive to the poisons and toxins in our environment than other's, and we need to take better care of ourselves. I ended up just turning vegan (in part for vanity's sake, in part in the spirit of compassion) and just cut out all the garbage I possibly can, and it's done wonders for my health!! After I quit eating dairy, most my allergies pretty much went away. So dark circles are basically a signal that something is off with your health, so to get rid of them for good, you'll need to do a little research and figure out what that might be for you. Sure can make a difference in one's appearance to be done with them!Btw, this product Will sting a little if you get it in your eyes, so don't get it in your eyes! But that's really nothing for how good it works. Most things sting if you get them in your eyes. Also, it's a gel, not a cream, so it doesn't moisturize. You need to make sure u use something else to do that. It can even dry a little if you use a lot like me. But nothing that a separate moisturizer can't cure. The trick I think with this product which determines how well it works is to use a lot. Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin. So use a lot, but avoid getting it on your lashes or in your eyes! ;)",beauty,skin care,eyes

"Straight out of the jar this stuff is overpowering, (Most people wouldn't take a bite of a fresh lime and expect it to go down easy.) but used sparingly to accentuate any dish it adds a wonderful complexity and delight that will leave you craving more even while there is a fork-full still in your mouth.I always mince it and then...Mix (a dime sized amount or less) with ranch dressing for salads.Spread a little on a tortilla with cheese and hummus... then pan toast.Mix a little in your chicken or tofu salad for sandwiches or wraps.Mix a little into any curry dish you like.Mix a touch of it with oil then spread on roasting meats.Pretty much any savory dish you like chili or lime in can be substituted with hot lime.

He is now nearly two and this toy is still a favorite. It has held up beautifully and my almost 3 yr old son rides it as well. My only complaint is that the handle/backrest/push bar doesn't attach securely to the train so it pulls out, this is most annoying when I'm carrying the ride on across the street and the train detaches from the handle and falls to the ground. Other than that, this is a great toy!",toys games,baby toddler toys,unknown

"I bought the Remington HS-500 from Amazon partially because one of the customer reviews on Amazon for this product said that it has a timer. The one I got does NOT have a timer, as I was a bit chagrined to discover.When I checked the underside of the product, the model number was HS 200 -- not HS 500--though it was shipped in the HS 500 box. One of the other reviewers indicates that s/he also did not get a timer with this. The HS 500 pictured on the Remington website, however, does have the timer. So, something is screwy. Until this is cleared up, I would not buy this product if the timer is important to you (though I suppose you could always buy a plug in timer, like those used for lamps, if you wanted to). Also, the product I received has a metal tub, whereas the HoMedics Par-250 (reportedly) has a cool-touch tub--safer, perhaps, but longer to melt (90 minutes according to the Remington website, 4-5 hours according to the HoMedics website). What you do get with the Remington HS-500 are very nice, cushy mits and a wrap to keep the wax warm longer on your hands, feet, and elsewhere, and nicely scented wax, which adds to the luxuriousness of the experience. But--again--No timer on the 200s shipped in the 500 box, No cool touch tub (just to set the record straight)!",beauty,skin care,hands nails

"I am pretty happy with this purchase. It has worked exactly as expected. I have been using this to store my dog food for a couple of months now. I like that the wheels let me roll it around easily and the airtight seal keeps the dog food smell contained. I do wish it was a little taller though, as the big 35-40 pound bags of dog food are a bit difficult to squish down in this when they are new. They will fit, but it is difficult to fully close the container with a brand new bag and I sometimes wonder if I am going to put too much stress on the lid or the seal by forcing it down in order to latch it, although it has not appeared to do any damage yet. Even with this minor issue, I am actually planning to buy a second one now, since my two dogs now eat different foods for health reasons. I have not had any issues with this item so far and although I don't absolutely love it, it does what it says and gets the job done.

The music also plays for a really long time, and the only way we could see to turn it off was to take a ring off or put one on the thing. Also, it reacts to vibrations, so if it is sitting on the floor and someone runs by it it will start going off!

"I've bought a couple of these for my Airedale puppy who constantly wants to chew. These things are amazing in that they have bone, tendon, meat, and knuckles still attached. She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her. The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare). The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on. The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.

The door locks still will not line up unless I push down on the top each time I put him in there. This manufacturer needs to seriously re-evaluate how they package such a heavy item for shipping.

"We've had this since Christmas and I think I can make a fair assessment now.Opening the box:The product was undamaged and put together for Christmas morning. It went together in less than 10 minutes.First Run:The batteries would only hold a 5 min charge... but that was enough to get my son excited about the prospect of riding his own quad. Razor got new batteries to us within 10 days. No complaints on the service. (Do not let batteries freeze!!) The batters installed more easily than expected.Battery Life:After charging it up, my 6-year-old son got on and was VERY surprised. He rode for over an hour and didn't exhaust the battery.Power:We live on a pretty steep hill and he can ride up and down with no problem. Power is very good... about 1/2 hp, enough to maintain forward motion for a 35-degree slope with a 50lb rider. Top speed is about 9mph. 3x walking speed. It can exceed that on a downhill slope, since it freewheels downhill. I have great video of him doing donuts in the driveway after a light snow.Braking:The disk brake works well, stopping the quad effectively on the downhill side. It has enough strength to skid the tires if necessary.Stability:Our son can run it on a hillside without it tipping, but I wouldn't recommend it without adult supervision. The solid rear axle and rigid front mean that in tight turns one tire drags (no differential) and that on uneven surfaces only 3 of the wheels will be in contact with the ground.Fit, Finish, Durability:Construction quality is good all around. It should outlast the power toy type by a long shot. Maintenance is minimal... keep the chain and bearings lubricated...esp. in dirty or wet environments.Summary:As a kid's toy... highly recommended. Be aware of the suspension limitations and all should be well. Cheers!Update 2011-DecemberStill running strong... almost grown out of it.",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons

One of the issues I have with the book, is that my son often wants to replay a song and I would like to see a re-play button on the unit so that he doesn't have to turn the page and turn it back to hear the song again. In addition, the pages could be a bit thicker for durability. Those small issues aside, this toy is well worth the money and is great fun.",toys games,learning education,unknown
"I bought this doll for my 19 month old daughter because she like to pretend to feed everything she comes in contact with. I of course only let her use a empty bottle and the empty dish and spoon. She enjoys very much that her baby makes noise and will move her mouth when she feeds her but this doll looks horrible. The hair is skimpy and you can see every single strand, then the rest is painted on giving it a very freaky fake look. I think it would have looked much better if she would have plastic hair or the company would have taken the time to do something more with it. I noticed in the first day baby alives face gets very dirty with dust. If you lay her down on the carpet the little carpet dust particles sticks to her face. Even with not feeding her real food and only a empty bottle the paint on her lips is already coming off.Her clothes are rough and cheap made. Over all this doll is not worth what they are charging. I found it discounted at a local store for $12.00. For that I am very grateful because I don't think she's even worth that. If my daughter didn't love this ugly mutant looking doll so much I would return it back to the store.",toys games,dolls accessories,dolls
"Pros:Fits easily.Doesn't kill your shoulder (depends on your child I'm sure).We take this on vacation, when we go to the beach or something, and walk around the boardwalk and stuff like that. Everyone comments either on it or how cute our baby is, or a combination of those.Cons:I guess the safety issues are the only thing I can think of to list for a con. You cannot buy these type of slings at a box store like Babies ""R"" Us; I'm guessing because of people saying that children can suffocate. But we started using this with our child around the age of 8 weeks, and at that point, our baby was big enough that she fit such that it didn't look like a safety hazard for her at all. So I would caution someone to wait at least two months before using an item like this, but otherwise, we've never thought twice about it, and our child has been fine.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers

"Clue is the classic game by Parker Brothers. In the game you stuck are in a mansion. The owner Mr.Boddy has been murdered and its up to you to find out who did it.There are six different playable characters. No character can do something others can't the only differnce in them is there starting locations and there actual names. Your goal is to navigate the mansion finding out clues as to who committed the murder. You have to guess who did it, where the murder was done, and what was is done with. You go by trial and error throughout the house until you gather enough clues to guess it right.The game itself is pretty durable. You have six token pieces, a six sided die, cards, a standard board, and paper sheets for you clue book. Unless something gets wet you should be set.The game is educational because it makes you think. You have to keep track of your clues that you collect. You can also pick up other clues by paying attention to other peoples clues and who is proving them wrong. You can be quite savvy in the game and this part is quite educational and fun.Clue is a classic game. People have been playing it for over 50 years. It's the classic game of who did it and it's a fun mystery. No game is ever the same and that makes it even more fun. No kid or adult should ever go there life without playing this game. So go get Clue and find out who did it.",toys games,games,board games
"I have been experimenting with pods in my Breville to save money. The pods (used in the pod holster) are hit or miss. The Senseos don't seem to have enough coffee in them to stack up well in the holster. Then I found these Gloria Jeans cups. Sure, they cost a little more than the pods, but they work a whole lot better. I get a much richer cup of coffee and can even use them for the largest size on the Breville and still maintain plenty of flavor. It makes sense that these machines will make the best coffee when using the proprietary equipment rather than cutting corners to save a few cents.

"To really impress me with a sunless tanner I need to see 4 things:1. Good natural color2. Ease of application3. Non-offensive odor4. Good product ingredientsIf a sunless tanning product can do all of those things well then I will be a fan for life and pay good money for the product.MyChelle's Del Sol Bronzer is a good product, but falls short in just a couple of places:1. The color is natural looking. It is a lighter ""sunkissed"" look on first application (especially if you are really fair to start with) but the package does say to reapply again in 12 hrs for a deeper ""tan"" look. I would say that it will definately take a couple applications to get anything that is worthy of being called a tan at all but the color is pretty good if you do.2. The creme/lotion is a nice consistancy and is easy to apply (I always wear disposable gloves with self-tanners) and is actually quite moisturizing, but it could definately use some kind of additional ""guide color"" in the ingredients to help you make sure it is going on evenly and being rubbed in well in all areas. It is possible to find some slight streaking if you do not get it rubbed in evenly.3. The intial scent of the lotion is mild and pleasent but the processing smell is one of the stronger ones. I will even catch a wiff of the DHA the middle of the next day (after I have showered and shaved even since the initial application from the night before). It almost seems like it contines to process even after the 12hrs suggested on the box.4. As always MyChelle does a great job with developing really good products using only some of the best natural ingredients. The DHA in this one comes from the natural sugars of beets and sugar cane and also contains other beneficial ingredients like licorice, aloe vera, and coconut oil that will soften the skin like a great body lotion even before the overnight processing takes place.The only other comment I have is that the bottle is much smaller than it's competitors and it is easy to use it up quickly if you are covering the whole body instead of just select body parts like your legs. Most sunless tanners come in bottles of at least 4 oz.My favorite natural sunless tanner is still from ""Beautisol"" but overall this is a good product worth using even if it could be improved with a more generous offering, some additional guide color and something more to combat the odor during the processing phase and just after.",beauty,skin care,sun

"This particular ORKA toy is a must have for any dog who loves to fetch. I have beenpuchasing these for my dogs for over a year. Our dog,""Ramsey"" LOVES to play with the ORKA BALL. He's a cattle dog who we run a few times a day. This ball is gentle to the dogs teeth, bounces so the person throwing it doesn't have to throw as far, and he loves to catch it in the air on a bounce. The ball also floats which has saved us a couple of times. The blue color is easy to see in the outdoors, so it's easy to find if the dog gets distracted and puts it down. Ramsey chews on the ball and it is the ONLY dog toy that he can't destroy. I was told by our local pet rep that ORKA discontinued this model, and I was crushed. Fortunately I found some on Amazon.com.I hope ORKA will appreciate how great this ball is and keep making them.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"I tried potty training my 22-month old with regular underwear, but after one day, I saw that every time he wet his pants it ran onto the floor and in between the tiny cracks in our hardwood floors. Ick! After trying to clean between the floorboards twice, I gave up and immediately ordered these training pants, and re-started potty training once they arrived. They did the trick. When my son had an accident, the training pants and his clothes got wet, making him realize what happened, but his shoes and the floors were dry. The clean-up was much easier. As he improved, he would wet the training pants just a bit, realize he was about to have an accident, and stop and go do the rest on the toilet. The training pants are just absorbent enough to keep these mini-accidents off his clothes. So all I had to change were the training pants--his clothes were dry! Now he wears them as regular underwear; they are super soft, and he loves them. My one recommendation is that you buy more than one package. Three pairs are not enough to make it through the day when you are first starting, particularly with boys. I got by with two packages by doing a load of wash every day. It's not a waste, since they can wear them as regular underwear once they get the hang of things. Thanks to these training pants, my son is not yet two, and is already potty trained!

"This is a quick review since it's almost time for Christmas, I will be back later for a fuller review.I've been waiting to buy a dollhouse for my 3 1/2 yo because she hadn't really been that interested plus she has a sister whose 18mos younger. So I didn't want something with all those little pieces everywhere or little pieces to eat.This set is so nice. Here's what I like.*Bigger pieces & Bigger People. Not too big for little hands, though. Mom is 5 1/2"", Dad is 6"" tall. Their clothes DON'T come off. So no little clothing pieces to be picking up or wasting time dressing them in order to play. Polly's & Bratz & such are nice, but are nice for my older daughter and she can keep little sisters out of her room when playing with her stuff.*People that stand by themselves w/ no help. Even if the feet/legs/back aren't quite right. Which little kids aren't going to get them in perfect alignment. It's cute, you can even bend Dad over at the sink like he's washing his hands and adjust his knees a little and he still stands!! Maybe it's been a long time since I've seen dolls & dollhouses, but this is nice.*Mom and Dad's thighs and knees are articulated well enough that they can sit nicely in the kitchen chair or sofa and not fall off. The thighs move up plenty so that there legs and back end are even. Some dolls I have seen don't bend far enough and they slide out of their chairs.*Food/cups molded onto trays. There are 2 trays. One with 2 cups of coffee/cocoa and such molded onto the tray. The other has a slice of pizza and a soda can molded on. So no little cups or pizza falling off and being lost. The tray's diameter measures almost 1 1/2"". So, that is not as likely to get lost. or possibly eaten by a younger child. But I will probably put those pieces up for a little while longer just to be safe.Since this is recommended for 3+, I wouldn't necessarily buy this for a child under 3. But if you have a 3 yr old and were wondering, these pieces - people and furniture are big enough to not have to fret over you're little one getting ahold of them.*The computer desk has the mouse and computer attached to it. The keyboard is attached to the keyboard holder and only the keyboard holder slides out. I like it alot.I don't forsee us folding up the sides of the house as I will be putting it on a desk for now and keeping it out to play with. So I like the ones that fold up completely and you can put away, but with the other things I listed I think this will do nicely for the time being.I also saw in the store and online, that some of the pieces have strings attached to them so I quess those won't wander off. Like the coffee pot in the kitchen set.I also liked that you can open the dishwasher in that set and put dishes in there or put things in the oven.

"The device seems to work, but the accompanying software and directions for its use are abysmal. I am a former software engineer, and it still took me considerable time playing with the software and the USB connection to get things to work. The directions for using the PC-Link are basically useless. The directions don't even tell a user that he must set the unit to PC-Link to start transmissions. This may be obvious to someone with a software background, but I'd be willing to bet that it's not obvious to the typical user.The unit can handle up to two users, and my wife and I both use it. However, it is very easy to forget to set it to the correct user before taking the measurement. That, of course, fouls up the stored set of measurements, and there appears to be no way to correct such a mistake. The unit has no warnings or safeguards to make sure that you are set on the correct user when taking a measurement.Also, the batteries do not last very longOh, yes, after uninstalling and installing the software three times, the install software neglected to put the help files (not very useful anyway) in place on the hard drive.All in all, I would not recommend this unit.

I couldn't carry the bottle for flights and I often had to clean the dirty cloth. After reading the positive reviews for Clarity Lens Cleaning Cloth I made the purchase, because it came in convenient pouches, were disposable, and they said the cloth did not leave streaks. The price was a bit more than I wanted to spend, but I was willing to try something new and hopefully better. There are 21 cloths in each box.I was surprised that as soon as I opened the package the cloth had a strong smell of chemicals, almost as potent as nail polish. I was worried the chemicals might irritate my eyes when I put my glasses on. I also did not like that the stinky smell got on my hands so I had to wash my hands each time.

We shouldn't have worried-- both cats took to the litterbox just fine and actually use it more frequently than they did our previous litterbox. For our cat with urinary problems, this is an added bonus since cats tend to develop urinary problems partly due to not using the box frequently enough. They seem to like the privacy the cover provides. It is easy to clean, and it cuts down tremendously on litter box odor and litter tracking. Highly recommended product, worth every penny.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking
"I have been using this exact brand (this tube, and everything) for about 8 years with my cats. One loves the flavor, but the other one if iffy and sometimes eats it.Pros:-It's good and sticky, easily staying on a finger for cat to lick off.-Malt-flavor is appealing to most cats (4 out of 5 of mine over the years).-It works well for maintenance/prevention.-It works when the cat starts coughing if given right away.Cons:-Some cats won't like the sticky texture. (But all seem to like the smell!)-It is petroleum-based, which can reduce nutrient absorption if given before or with meals.-Does not currently ship via Amazon Prime.Bottom line",pet supplies,cats,health supplies

Save your UPC codes from the package and when you get to 10 you can mail them in for a rebate. These are great for when we leave the dog at home alone, or travel with him.

"This is my second T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 3 1/2 years, as the second one is a replacement for the first featherweight that stopped working. I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores. I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair. I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron. I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron. My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair. Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less). I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out. It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers. With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it's no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 & the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers. Now I have noticed that Bespoke Labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years!!! Interesting!",beauty,hair care,styling tools

"When I read the positve reviews on this product, I ordered it. It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium, this soup would fit the bill. If you are just trying to cut back on salt, again this soup will work fine. I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try. I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit, it has very little flavor. It's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste. Truthfully, I miss the salt. I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland. When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference. Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin. I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial. I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes. I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products. However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful. I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious. More companies should do the same. Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food

He likes that it can be used corded (in case the battery would run down) or cordless, and that it came with a travel bag. I think it's nice that you can rinse it in water but, again, he usually doesn't have that option.In closing, he said it was the best gift I could have gotten for him.

I used them to make my own vanilla extract and my entire house smelled wonderful! Not sure why some other reviewers didn't find them as aromatic... must be a bum batch. Sorry that happened to them. I hope that doesn't happen to me as I will be ordering more and more and more of these.

"I bought this toy for my 3-year-old daughter as we are getting ready to travel. It is taking her a little while to get her head around it, which is exactly the type of educational toys I like - it prompts development and keeps interest for longer than a couple of days. The toy is well made, has a nice rubbery base that imitates embroidery. Using a pin and a thread is a great exercise for fine motor skills development. The set has several patters a child could try to replicate, and here you have color-matching and pattern-matching skills working, plus early counting as it takes to count how many holes left, right, up, or down you have to go to make the pattern. Moreover, it often takes two-step counting, such as three hole left and one down, so get it right. Later on a child can create their own pictures (which may require to buy additional colorful shoe strings, though). The toy is light and self-containing, with a little handle, so a child can carry it with him/her. The toy is clearly too hard for my daughter to do by herself at this point, but she can do it with my assistance (again, that's the best kind of an educational toy, as children get to learn new skills from adults). Overall, this is a great find for long car and plane rides, or just to do at home on a rainy day.",toys games,arts crafts,unknown

"I had done quite a bit of reading and came across some chatter about this horse/pet product causing wonderful results on humans. This conditioner is marketed as a regrowth/rebuilder/repairer for animals' coats, skin, hoofs, paws. The claims of human hair regrowth/thickening were what interested me. There are quite a few comparisons to a similar product, Ovation Cell Therapy that is purported to be more expensive w/ similar or same ingredients. I have not tried Ovation nor have I bothered to do an ingredient comparison, but I can tell you that Ovation's manufacturer (DH Labs) = its parent company is EQyss - the company that makes Mega-Tek.I have ordered from Amazon (twice - got the small 2 oz size first to try, loved so much, went back and ordered the 16 fl oz full size.)Instructions are to apply as a conditioner, leave on for 5 min and then rinse out. I have used on a daily basis for a month and I LOVE it! Its white consistency is a little thicker than my ordinary daily conditioner, but not as thick as a deep conditioner. It has a light almost tropical scent.I started by using as an all over conditioner, which was great, but since no one can re-grow hair at the ends, and due to the expense, I have been using on only my scalp for the past few weeks and then letting the rinsing action coat the rest of my hair like a normal conditioner.I see less hair coming out when I rinse my hair and less on my hairbrush when styling. I can't speak to regrowth (I have a LOT of hair, but it is VERY fine, so I can't tell if there is regrowth) , but I can say it certainly does make my fine, color-treated layered bobbed hair look/feel thicker, fuller and like there is more of it and the effect, once I style and spray hairspray, lasts all day!From my bottle",pet supplies,cats,grooming

"Teeth clog easily and often. Using the trimmer guards makes this worse and it doesn't cut hair at all. Each time the guard must be taken off to clear out the teeth, and in addition the guards pop off unexpectedly. You must pass over an area MANY times to get MOST of the hair. This takes a very long time to use with a so-so result. Although the small teeth do not cause large knicks in the skin, they do tend to get caught under flat laying hairs, they then dig into the skin while ripping off large chunk at the same time. This creates a larger and more painful blemish than I have ever experienced with any other product - electric or manual. Blood everywhere. Before this I bought a new Braun 360 with the auto cleaning stand. I waited to use it on other areas than my face until this arrived, because I thought the trimmer specifically marketed to men shaving delicate areas would work better. WRONG, obviously the Braun is in a different class and much more expensive. It also works. Now I use it after I do my face and then put it in to clean and have a fresh razor every time. Perfect. I waited about two weeks to give it a second chance, It really couldn't be as bad as I remember, right? After five minutes I was fed up, and I returned it the same day.

"I play in a weekly poker with some friends from work. It's a $10 game of Texas Hold 'em with about 8 people. It's nothing special, but I wanted to make my own contribution to the group, so I spent some time researching playing cards. These playing cards are some of the best in the world. They're imported from Brazil and were the official playing cards of the 2005 World Series of Poker. The brand is amazing. These cards are unique in 2 ways. First, they're made of plastic. It does take a little getting used to, they slide much quicker on the table and feel a little weird, but not in a completely foreign way. You can't bend the cards like you're folding paper. They will get a crease in them. However, you don't have to worry about them getting bent or ripped. We've been playing with the same deck for 6 months and no markings, creases, or any other signs of wear on them. If you get them wet, you can wipe them clean and in an hour or so, they're fine! Secondly, these are 4 color playing cards. Spades are black, Hearts are red, Diamonds are blue, and Clubs are green. I'll admit, we have a few cocktails while playing and at first it was a little distracting, but once you get used to the colors, it makes playing much easier. The only problem is that the people I'm playing against can more easily spot a flush! They're a little bit more expensive than regular playing cards, but well worth it. You get two packs. One with a red backing and one with a blue backing. We like to have 2 decks going at the same time (Small Blind does the shuffling) in order to keep the game going faster. Two colors means no chance of mixing up decks. Also note these are poker size cards which is what the vast majority of people use. Bridge size is slightly thinner.",toys games,games,standard playing card decks

I've used my MS3-2000 for almost 2 years now. The shave I received from it has always been quite good.The problem with the trimmer not locking down started happening to it within 3 months of use. I called customer service and they said to make sure you clean it well. This really means to use the brush and get in there to clean it.This resolved the trimmer not locking until about 3 months ago. Then it took brute force to make it lock down.Now it does not lock down whatsoever. I just bought a Norelco.,health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"I rate this product *****! For sore muscles, muscle spasms that linger no matter what other product has been taken, for joints, sore knees, elbows, and especially sore backs, this product works like a charm. However, using it in mild doses as recommended doesn't give the same effect that taking 1/2 - 1 teaspoon when the need calls for it.

"The SEA GIFT KOREAN ROASTED & SEA SALTED SEAWEED SNACKS are a wonderful treat if you like snacks with good flavor.I like well-seasoned foods and even though these have a nice salted flavor, I would have preferred a saltier taste. But these seaweed sheets have just the right amount of flavor for most people.If you don't know what seaweed snacks are they are sheets of dehydrated seaweed that's been roasted and seasoned with salt or soy sauce, and can be eaten either with rice or alone. They're thin like paper and slightly different from the type of seaweed that's used for wrapping sushi, which is not seasoned.Each seaweed rectangular sheet measures about 3.25"" x 2.25"" and comes in 11 sheets per package. There are 24 packs in each order so that's plenty for making rice balls or adding to other dishes or just eating alone.I agree with another reviewer who stated that there was a lot of packaging for such a small amount in each pack, but I've tried other dried ""nori"" seaweed snacks and once you open the container, you have a set amount of time to eat all the seaweed or it will get hard and stick together. Perhaps that's why these are packaged individually in sheets of 11.Anyway, I really like these seaweed snacks and will be ordering more!",grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown
"I bought this about 3 months ago. It works fairly well for about the first month and a half, then it starts dying. It finally got to the point where it just clicks without moving. I called the customer service, who are supposed to be open until 8 EST. They weren't, so I called from work. The first time I called, they said that I needed the model number before they could talk to me. The person I talked to also said that they were open until 8, and that I could call when I got home. I told her that I had tried the night before, and she said that they were having phone problems that night. So, I went home, and tried calling again. Still not open after 6. So I got the model number, and called again from work. Mind you, each time you call, you have to wait for at least 10 or 15 minutes on hold until you get someone. I finally got another person, who told me that I now need the date code. So back home, check the date code, and call back during work again next day. ""Sorry, that's the wrong date code."" I needed to open up the cover for the computer chip and pull it out. The number was written on the chip in pen. I also took the unit apart to find out what was actually wrong with it. There is a cheap plastic gear inside the mechanism that got bent, and that is what was causing the problem. So, I called back today. Finally, they told me that I had to cut the computer chip off, and send that with a check for $10 to their company for shipping and handling, and they would send me a new unit. I asked for a supervisor, and was told that I was talking to one. I told her that the product is junk, and that the service is horrible. She said she was sorry to hear that, and I hung up. Don't waste your money on this product. There's got to be something better out there. By the way, email apparently doesn't work either...I sent one four days ago and never got anything more than an autoreply saying that someone would get back to me in 48 hours or less.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"We monitor 2 children. Rather than scan, as some have mentioned, for a while we put both receivers by the bed at night and put one on A and one on B, so we got continuous monitoring of both children.But we do get the POPPING noise! So now I also have a cheap Safety 1st ($16) monitor in the baby's room-it works great...and for my 3 year old, we use this one but if it is popping, I turn it down pretty low because he will yell or come to my room.Love that it recharges! The cheapy I have in the baby's room does not, it has to be plugged in...so if we are watching tv in the den, I use this one to monitor her.So overall I have been satified. I tried many other monitors trying to find 2 that would work together. That was like looking for a needle in a haystack. I did have one Sony 27 channel that I liked, and it worked with our original that we used with our first child, but it often beeped in my room saying it was out of range. So I took it back and got this one.I am having a problem that has just started, the sound shorts out on one of the receivers...if I jiggle the volume dial it comes back but goes out again in the night.

For those of you who do not know, a guillotine was a device used to execute people by decapitation.At first I looked at this game and was shocked that it's premise is about chopping off various noble's heads for points. Gory, right? And how about inappropriate? Maybe a little. But it was already purchased and brought home, so I gave it a chance as I do with all games. The game's premise is comedic, and not actually meant to offend anyone.

"There is few dollar of difference between refined and unrefined. I only cook with extra virgin olive oil since the mono to poly unsaturated oil is 7 compare to almond 4.1 and coconut 3.2. Applying heat to poly-unsaturated fat creates unhealthy factors compared to mono-unsaturated fats. Now, once in a while it is fine for me if the oil is becoming rancid to use as cooking oil and consume before the 6 months window before the nut oil going rancid but on regular basis it is not a good idea. There is two type of nut oil, and unlike one reviewer who puts PHD next to her name and misinforms, refined is an oil that is missing some characteristics of the nut like smell and taste and for that reason you can apply more heat to refined since it is missing certain ingredients which can burn during cooking and create unpleasant conditions. Not having smell has nothing to do with organic or conventional seed. Coconut is the healthiest of all but it is like a cream not a lotion so I use coconut oil for hands and feet. Any nut oil should be good enough that you can consume it raw or use it in cooking and Spectrum is the better one since it really is sold all over right next to all other cooking oils instead of health section. I like Spectrum because of the glass container.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements
"I am a 14 year old girl, and ever since I hit puberty, I began to sweat like you wouldn't believe. At first I thought it was normal, but then I realized that it wasn't, that people (for the most part) don't sweat like that.I couldn't wear anything form fitting or stylish. If I did, the sweat rings would be even MORE visible. I was reduced to wearing loose baggy shirts, or hiding myself completely, under sweaters and jackets. There was nothing else I could do.It wasn't just a little bit of underarm moisture, either. I would get dressed for school, head downstairs for breakfast, and the perspiration had already begun! At school, even in an air conditioned classroom, I would perspire constantly and incessantly, for no reason at all. I couldn't raise my hand either; I had to keep my arms plastered against my sides so no one would see the massive perspiration rings, which were getting bigger by the minute. I worried constantly about it; the question was always on my mind, ""How bad is it now?"".Temperature and emotions weren't the cause, either. I could be perfectly relaxed on a cool autumn day; sitting here at the computer surfing the net, or standing in the snow on a cold winter's day. Yet, in all three cases, I'd be sweating like it was 100 degrees outside.I tried every ""anti-perspirant"" under the sun, NOTHING worked. Lady Speed Stick, Secret, Dove, Mitchum, Arm and Hammer, Arrid; you name it, I've tried it. And none of them, I repeat, NONE of them worked. It was hopeless.I was so embarassed to do normal things; hug someone, raise my hand in class, come to school without a jacket. I thought I'd be stuck with this humiliating problem forever. Then I found Certain Dri.I cam across this website, and after reading people's success stories, I was ready to try it myself. I was a bit skeptical, but I was hopeful. I put some on that night, and the next day I went to school and waited to see the floods of perspiration. They never came. I went the WHOLE DAY with pits as dry as the Sahara Desert. Now, I'm not afraid to raise my hand in class, to wear stylish shirts, to hug my friends, or to come to school with no jacket or sweater. My humiliating problem is over now. And its all thanks to Certain Dri.If you've suffered embarassing perspiration like I did, give Certain Dri a shot. You won't regret it.",health personal care,personal care,deodorants antiperspirants

"OK, this is going to be a tough one. O'My O Clitoral Stimulating Gel is a water-based (glycerin) gel that is designed to stimulate the clitoris by using menthol to produce a tingling sensation, and as such a heightened sensitivity. The idea is that you will apply it in drips, until you reach the desired level of tingle.My first problem with this stuff is that it works best for solo play. Your lover will be hard-pressed to know how much to apply unless you talk him through it, which is somewhat less than sensuous. My second problem is that if you use too much of this stuff, it will produce an unpleasant burning sensation, rather than an erotic tingling one, and when used by a couple, that's too likely.Some women seem to swear by this stuff, whereas others swear *at* it. Similarly some men have complained about burning, whereas others have never felt any such thing. This suggests that results will be somewhat individualistic. So, you'll need to buy some to experiment with, and it's not cheap. On the up side, the fact that it is water-based which means that it will not interfere with condoms.Overall, I was not impressed with this stuff. At first I found the sensation quite stimulating, but before too long it began to just burn. So, for me it didn't work, whereas for the next woman it will.

Additionally, the excessive amount of openings on the razor head guard only lead to more irritation, not a quick, smooth shave as advertised. I also find it somewhat awkward to use the pop up trimmer. It comes up from the rear, which means you have to hold the razor backward to use it. If I want to invert the trimmer to buzz up underneath my sideburns, I have to hold the trimmer in place otherwise it will fold back down and close.Needless to say, I am sending this razor back to Norelco and purchasing the Cool Skin 7735X - an updated model of the razor that gave me a close, smooth, painless shave for almost 2 years.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

These helped considerably, at first. But they did flatten out fairly quickly.

"I can't say enough good things about this product. First, I use a lot of Source Naturals products, and in my experience, they are always of high quality at a very reasonable price.Now as to why I'm taking this supplement...I'm working on recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome caused by leaky gut and gut dysbiosis (severe Candida infection for the last several years). I've read that people take 15-20 g of this a day to heal the gut. I started taking it on an empty stomach before meals, and the effects have been life-changing; and, no, I'm not being dramatic. It turns out that during times of stress, glutamine in the skeletal muscle can become depleted by up to 50% (perhaps even more based on some statistics I've read). The body needs glutamine to fuel immune cells and to repair tissues; the liver needs glutamine for detoxification, etc. So the body snags from skeletal muscle the glutamine that it needs. Although the body is able to make glutamine from other amino acids in the diet, during periods of prolonged stress (like chronic infection or disease), the diet simply is unable to provide a sufficient supply. This has certainly been true in my case. I seem to eat and eat all day long, but it's never enough for all the repair that is going on inside my body - yet I still have no energy. It's frustrating. This product has changed that. I'm not miraculously cured or anything like that, but it has certainly made a big difference in my quality of life as I continue to recover. I've got a lot more energy now, much less muscle aches, less difficulty digesting, and less allergies after eating. I am able to sleep through the night without waking due to hypoglycemia, and I no longer wake in the morning with muscle pain and fatigue. In short, I just feel a heck of a lot better.I can't speak for everyone, of course, but in my experience, I recommend that anyone working on recovering from a chronic illness take glutamine. Sift through the scientific journal articles online; many studies have been done, particularly on its effectiveness on healing and protecting the gut.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

Just as expected. Make sure to keep it dry before you mix it or it will tend to clump. Better to put it into the water vs. other way around. And make sure that you very carefully wash out the bottom and top of the bottle you are using. It can leave a residue. My son uses 3/4 of the recco'd amount to make it easier to drink. Says it really helps stay properly hydrated much better than the regular gatorade.

Not at all fuzzy.After playing with him a bit, I was disappointed even further for the following reasons:1. He is quite loud, and there is no volume control.2. It is very hard to get the binky in his mouth and keep it there.3. The control in his hand to make him sing is at the thickest part of his hand, making it hard for my my daughter (then 8 months, now 10 months) to squeeze it to make the singing start.4. The song is very short and there is only one song, so it gets boring quickly for her.On the plus side:1. Several moments after the singing stops, Elmo asks for his binky, please. Cute.2. My daughter will pick him up and play with him for a bit. (Usually looks for me to make him sing).3. She laughs at the popping noise when you pull the binky out of his mouth.I think there are better products out there than this one. It obviously wasn't so poor I felt compelled to expend the energy to return it, but I do recommend you keep looking if you want something truly interactive for your inquisitive baby.I am considering the Elmo Loves You or the Elmo Knows Your Name (which allows you to program in your childs name, favorite foods, and schedule) for birthday gifts.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,unknown

My 3-year old loves to color. This seat was easy to use and she can even buckle it herself. It holds her crayons and gives her a nice surface to use with her coloring books in the car. This was a life-saver for us on our last trip. It is also great for eating on (her crackers didn't fall off). I would definitely recommend it for those who travel in the car to see family.,baby products,car seats accessories,accessories

"At 1/3 the price of the similar Bugaboo Frog, the Britax Vigour stroller is tough to beat.The wheels are large, and the front wheels have spring shock absorbers, making walks with baby on cracked sidewalks a breeze. It's very maneuverable, and rolls silky smooth. Rolls easily on grass, too, for those trips to the park.The seat is comfortably padded, can face forwards or rearwards, and has an ingenious ""infinite adjustment"" to tilt the seat very precisely at any angle. The 5-point harness, with two height adjustments, holds the child securely. The seat is very easy to add and remove from the stroller.There is adequate storage under the seat, with waterproof plastic on the bottom for those rainy days.The construction is impressive, and the unit is very well made. It even came with a portable air pump for the rear tires.The minor drawbacks are that the sunshade is on the small side (could have used another 6 inches of coverage), and the unit is not light. However, it's not light, because it's made out of metal instead of cheap plastic.None of these drawbacks are a big deal, and I would but it again tomorrow. It's a great stroller.It's age-rated for ""6 months and up"" but we put our 15lb 3-month-old in there with no problems. She loves the smooth ride, and since the shock absorbers soak up bumpy pavement, the baby sleeps uninterrupted on walks.There is also a bassinet sold in England, which could be ordered.We're very happy with this unit.",baby products,strollers,travel systems
"I have been using a hair serum to smooth and condition my hair for some time. I finally used up my bottle so put out feelers for a new product. Unfortunately, most of the products recommended to me are not available at Wal-mart in the middle of the ngiht so I opted for John Frieda Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum rather than the one other product, despite its higher price tag.I suffer with some frizz and fly-aways, especially because my hair is so fine. It can look pretty unkempt only a short time after I brush it so I wanted a product which would smooth it and not let it be quite so unruly. While Frizz Ease Extra Strength Serum does work, it's rather heavy and leaves my hair feeling greasy.This serum is very comparable to Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum although I prefer the bottle because it looks sleeker (but it comes in a much smaller bottle). Frizz Ease Serum does a better job, in my opinion, but does not smell as nice. It does not smell unpleasant but it does smell a bit too much like perfume and chemicals to me.The bottle instructs to apply a dime sized amount to wet hair. Oddly enough, the official website says to use a quarter sized amount and I think this makes more sense. I like to apply the serum to my brush so my hands do not get greasy. Unfortunately, whether I am using my brush or my hands, the product does not apply evenly. The first area where I apply the product tends to get a thick coating and the rest of my hair sees much less. Of course, this is a problem with any serum.What I do not especially like is how greasy my hair feels. It does not necessarily look greasy but if I touch it with my hands or feel my hair brush my face, I can tell. My hair generally looks really sleek and shiny but it does not have a lot of movement because of the heavy serum which makes clumps of hair stick together. At one point, it even left clumpy residue like cheaper gels. Other people probably wouldn't notice because I am the only one staring so intently at my hair, however.The problem is, that if I use less, it really doesn't work all that well. Even having my hair greasy, I'd say only about 75% of my fly-aways and frizz is smoothed down. While this is a decent amount, especially in humid San Antonio, I was looking for something that worked a little better, especially from such a big name.I think what it most disappointing is how long the bottle lasts. I've only have it a few weeks and it is already about halfway gone. When I used the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, it was in a much larger bottle that literally lasted me years.Overall, Frizz Ease Extra Strength Hair Serum is a product which works with a few drawbacks and has a price tag that will quickly add up with how frequently you will have to replace the product. I will keep on in my search for the perfect frizz product.",beauty,hair care,conditioners

"This product has only 28mg of sodium from the condroitin. I wanted a low sodium product. I carry the capsules in my pocket in a pill box and it holds up excellently, even in the hottest weather. It has no after-affects on me whatsoever.I have been on this type of supplement for a number of years now, so I have relegated my dosage to maintenance levels. This is normally half dosage, in this case two capsules per day instead of four. I have found out that the quality of this product permits me to take only one capsule per day. With my previous product, I could not do this, so in the long run I was spending more then.With four capsules per day, this product provides more latitude for fine tuning dosages than some products that have only two capsules per day. For me, it works just fine. For someone who needs all four capsules per day, it may cost more per day, but you may need only three. For cost reasons, I down-rated it by one star.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"My family, with children aged 8-13, really like this game. It's one of those all too uncommon games that our entire family can not only enjoy, but everyone can be competitive.PositivesThe game is different every time! I love this aspect. The game board is never the same twice.You have to think, but not so much so to prevent 7 or 8 year olds from being competitive.The play can move fairly quickly, even if the overall game does not.It teaches thinking skills. You have to plan out your strategy.It teaches some basic economics. You must have goods to build your developments and cities.It teaches bargaining. There is trading of goods between players, and this can be a lot of fun!NegativesDepending upon the players and layout, the game can take over 2 hours.The game uses dice. I hate dice... Dice introduce luck and chance. This doesn't bother a lot of people. It bothers me. But with this game, it doesn't bother me enough to keep me from playing it, primarily because it's a great game for the whole family.Lots of pieces. Don't lose any!Don't shake the table. The game board is made up of lots of tiles, and I mentioned all of the pieces. One person hitting the table can really mess things up!RecommendationsGet the expansion pack. The starter game is for 3-4 players. We almost always have more. The expansion pack lets you play with 5-6.Get the plastic ""game holders."" I don't know what these are called, but they are plastic, connecting pieces that go around the outside edge of the game tiles and prevent the tiles from going flying when someone bumps the table. Easily the best investment we've made for this game!Get something to put all of the pieces in. We use small baggies.

"I deducted one star for the ""pure vanilla powder"" name, and another for not being as aromatic as pure vanilla, so 3 stars. I read the description above and thought I scrutinized the wording well enough to detect any misdirection, so unfortunately I didn't get to the ingredients list. I have some Rodelle vanilla pods and the fragrance is amazing. Compared to any vanilla essence I've ever tried, it's like the difference between freshly roasted coffee beans and folgers. So I thought this ""pure vanilla powder"" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods. Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract.It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too. It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract, and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly).

You'll just probably have to cut more in order for it to stick again.)",pet supplies,dogs,beds furniture
"The Braun Syncro System shavers debuted in the US around the spring of 2000 with the 7000 series. They made quite a splash, looking quite different from the predecessor, the Braun Flex Integral (6000 series). I bought the 7526 model and used it for about 4 years before moving up to the 8000 Activator series. The model I actually have is the 8595. The 8995 is essentially the same model, only renamed with a different model convention (now 5 series instead of Activator system 8000 series).If you can find the 8595 Activator for less money, get it instead of the 5 series 8995. The differences from the 8995 are only cosmetic, and minor at that.MODELSThe Braun 5 Series line consists of several models",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"This is indeed ""dark"" chocolate and not ""bittersweet"" as the label on the Toblerone package indicates; so it is rather sweet, but unlike USA produced products still tastes like that apparently elusive substance known as chocolate. The honey almond nougat is unfortunately mostly lost amidst the chocolateness, but it gives the bar a nice crunch when it is hastily chewed, or a slight stickiness when the bar is slowly savored. In short you can make a meal out of--a portion--of this bar. It's not some vile brown sugary confection, nor is it a gourmet experience; it's simply a satisfyingly rich chocolate bar.",grocery gourmet food,candy chocolate,chocolate bars

"I bought this toy for my 26 month old daughter to keep her entertained at the hospital while awaiting the birth of her baby brother. She was fascinated by it and spent hours learning to lock and unlock the doors. She is now almost 4 and still enjoys the pretend play with the doctor's tools, and she likes to place various trinkets inside the compartments for safe-keeping. Now that my son is almost 2, he is starting to attempt to use the keys in the locks as well. It is a good way to introduce colors (which key matches which door), work on fine motor skills (locking/unlocking), and encourage pretend play. I love that all the pieces fit inside the lid at the top. But most of all, I love that this toy is designed for the child to do all the work.

"I use 2,000 mg/day of B-5 to treat a skin condition. Along with Adovia sulfur soap, this treatment works very well, and the condition has largely subside. There isn't much more I can really say. The FDA regulates these kinds of products and requires that manufacturers meet reasonable quality standards, so any comments I might make on such matters is beside the point. The dosage is very convenient for my purposes (only two big tablets a day), and the pricing is very competitive. I get so much of this in a bottle that it seems to last forever (not really, but I know I don't have to get more very often). Hope this helps.As a side note, I've noticed that Amazon carries a pretty good range of such supplements (and also OTC medications) in a generic form. I used to go to the local CVS or RiteAid for such things, but the products on Amazon are a much better deal.

"I originally purchased this perfume as a Christmas present for my girl friend. I had only purchased a 1oz bottle after smelling countless perfumes in a department store. Well it was a huge success and after she wore it for me for the first time I absolutely loved it on her. Great light scent, a sweet floral scent is the best way to describe it. Not overly powerful but very seductive in the way it draws you in. Plus as a benefit, it doesn't seem to transfer, so a nice lingering hug won't leave you smelling like your girl.So with that said when my girl friend ran out of her 1oz bottle I had to go out and purchase her some more, good timing it was her birthday. So I purchased the 3.4 oz bottle to make sure she had enough to last for a little while. The price I got was great and the shipping was great as well.",beauty,fragrance,women s

The problem we were having with every other bottles was that even with the slowest flow nipple it was too fast for him. With therse bottles he can control the rate of flow and doesn't end up gaggin on the formula. It did take a while for him to finish the bottle at first but now (at 2 months) he can finish 6 ounces in 15 minutes and he isn't covered in formula.

The instructions INSIDE the packaging emphasize that you must use FINE sugar which is 4x (not powdered and table sugar). After searching for 2 weeks trying to find FINE sugar, I finally found some. Eager to try the unit out, I discovered that the electrical cord had pulled out of the plug that attaches to the base unit. We're lucky we didn't start a fire. I soldered the loose wire back onto the plug and made ready for another attempt. In great anticipation, the cotten candy maker did make cotten candy ... about 4-5 strands. What a disappointment.

What made them useless was that they let milk get through my bra and shirt after less than a couple hours of use. They didn't actually seem to leak through to the other side, they seem to collect milk and then let it sink down to the rim of the pad where it leaks at the edge of the pad.

In order to charge or download music, the cap must be removed. There's no way to keep it attached to the player. This is a fairly critical flaw for something made for *kids*.2 - so far - play time is NOT 8 hours. Maybe we have a defective ""charger"" (the disney speaker stand was purchased also, and it seems defective). The MP3 player only played for 3 hours total - mostly on the stand, and only about 10 minutes off the stand before the player stopped working.Invest in a USB wall charger.I'm also NOT a fan of Disney's Mix Clips.

Ah man we had so much fun after i did that, that we kept using the idea, and made the game so much more fun. The last couple of nights we played before i had to leave, just 1 hand took us about a couple of hours to finish, it was like playing a game of Monopoly that you didn't know when it was going to finish as it was back and forth all night. I played with a strategy in mind whch was to prevent anyone but myself from winnning when they were low on cards and i had like 20 cards in my hand and all of them were draw twos and draw four cards and i combined them all in one play and kept the Wild Draw four as my ""Uno"" card to automatically win the game.

"First of all, everyone has a different body chemistry. I don't suggest you buy this product blind. Go into a store, and use a Tester. I tried it on at Sephora. I loved it! Try it on first!Second, this isn't a little girl's scent on me! It starts out citrusy, for a few minutes and then the floral notes come out to play. The citrus fades away and the red fruit comes out to mix with the florals turning it into a wonderful and sweet scent. Everything blends together so well that I can't even describe what it smells like, but it's delicious! The cotton candy finally comes out on top of the scent, but that doesn't make it any less beautiful, it still smells like something a strong, powerful, sexy woman would wear. Eventually the floral scent becomes kinda powdery. The powder, red fruit, and cotton candy is such a lovely scent. It's not overpowering to me at all.Cotton Candy is my favorite scent, and normally I would mind it being mixed with other things... not this time! This scent is now my signature scent. I've got severe allergies, and it doesn't cause me any problems with them. I'm so happy with Pink Sugar! No burnt notes for me, it's not so sweet it's sickening, it's just incredibly beautiful. I expect my man to pull me into his arms and take a good long sniff when he smells me wearing this!If you don't do a test sniff, and don't like it, try just dabbing a little on.

"I am writing this review more than ten months after purchasing it, and the 6.8 oz bottle is more than half full. You only need one or two spritzes because it's quite a strong fragrance and it lasts a very long time. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's worth to buy the 6.8 oz bottle over the 1.7 oz bottle because the 1.7 oz bottle is going for $54.99 on Amazon, while the 6.8 oz bottle is going for $99.99 currently. So you're getting four times the fragrance for $45.00 more. Yes, it's pretty steep, but well worth it if you like this fragrance and wear it often. Five out of five stars for the quality of this fragrance, as well as the fact that it will last the average person quite a long time.",beauty,fragrance,unknown

"I like the clean, elegant design and heavy, solid feel of this mirror. It looks nice on my bathroom counter. The three magnifications give it extra versatility -- great for putting on makeup, or for situations where you need extra close visibility, like getting a lash out of your eye (which happened to me just recently, and the high magnification inset made removing the offending object easier than ever).Although there are three levels of brightness provided by the built in illumination, they range from dim to really dim, unlike my previous 60s-era mirror that lit up the entire house and was probably visible from space. I rely on ambient lighting-assist with my new mirror.The on/off and brightness levels are controlled by tapping the base, which is fast and easy, almost too easy as it is common to touch it accidentally. I'm getting used to quickly tapping the base three times to get back to where I was when this happens.Overall, I'm very happy with this lovely, versatile mirror. The built-in light could be a little brighter, but it looks great, and it's got the magnification requirements well covered.",beauty,tools accessories,mirrors

Secondly, the middle seat has little room to grow. Thirdly, the seats are so close that the one in the back allows enough room for the baby to put his feet on the back of the seat in front. The stroller is also very cumbersome to collapse and heavy to pick up. It has worked okay up to now, but I think it is now time to invest in the Peg-Perego.",baby products,strollers,unknown

"1. I was charged for this product immediately, then emailed that it was backordered. It did finally arrive, took about 3 weeks total.2. It WORKS. I have 2 children, a boy almost 5, and a girl almost 7. He has been biting for a few months, she for probably a year. They both had absolutely NO nails left and also were biting the skin around the nail. I would tell them to stop when watching tv, etc, but could not stop them while they were at school, etc.3. It WORKS! They actually have nails! I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time. I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need. By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children. My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out. It does taste very bad - not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you stop biting and help remember not to bite next time. I think the habit is broken, but I will keep it on them for a week or so now to make sure!Also, there are a couple different listings on Amazon for this same product.",beauty,skin care,hands nails

"My dog was doing fine at first and would eat all his food when I set it down. I had used a football shaped dispenser before and he did really good. I don't think he likes the orange ball as much because, yes it is a lot of work and I think he gets discouraged or bored after 20 minutes. He doesn't even bother getting all the food out, he just gives up. Especially when there are a few 4-5 pieces inside that I can't even get out easily he just leaves it there. Sometimes he will practically leave half his food in there. He began letting the ball just sit there and lingering over it. Now he just walks away from his food after one bite. I think he is disinterested in the ball, maybe my dog is lazy. But then I tried walking him then setting his food in the food bowl and he still did the same thing, he didn't eat it up like he used to. So I don't know if the ball made him take a step back in learning/training or if he's just not interested in food anymore. But the ball definitely made him start to just let the food sit there and I think it's because he thinks the food will be there whenever he wants it so he's gonna eat it when he feels like it not when I say he should be eating. I don't think that behavior is right and he used to always eat when I said it was time to eat.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"Its a well designed, attractive unit.If you use the entire water chamber each time, it really doesn't leak. If you don't use it all, then dump it out after your done. For me, I enjoy using it so much, I always use the entire water chamber ... and it's enough to do the job, but none too big.After using the hydrabrush and then this, my teeth really do feel nearly dental hygienist clean.If you have problem with food getting stuck in your teeth, this is really excellent. Especially after eating meat, fruit or veggies that may get stuck in your teeth.You might even have to turn down the pressure if you have sensitive gums as this thing has a lot of water blasting power. My kids find it very fun and it comes with a wide range of attachments for almost anyone and the tounge cleaner is even cool. I love the tray on top that holds the attachements ... its functional and attractive.It's only a 4.5 because of the occasional problems starting it up ... but this is fixed by having a damp intake ... which I find isn't an issue if you use a FULL water chamber each time and just leave it seated in the unit till the next use.This really isn't a complete substitute for flossing, but consider a nice supplemental and sometimes use it instead of flossing. But really both would be better. Sometimes I substitute this for flossing if I don't have time for both.If you have sensitive teeth like me, use warm water instead of cold and it feels a lot better.It can be messy to use, so I recommend keeping your mouth shut during use, or lean over the counter close to the sink and it'll just spash the sink and not the mirror. Some splash is inevitable.I like the button to pause the water flow. If your halfway coordinated, you can pause it and reduce the mess considerably. For me, I'm not very coordinated, so I just lean into the sink and let it overspray a bit (into the sink). I think of it as ""controlled drooling"" ... but its fun to look down in the sink and see how much stuff this actually removes ... even after brushing and flossing.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"I read lots of great reviews for this razor and ordered it with high expectations. I've been using it for about three weeks now and I have to say that I'm not nearly as impressed as everyone else seems to be. Maybe I got a bad unit or something. It feels nice in the hand and it seems quite powerful and the pop-up trimmer works great. But I'm just not getting a very close shave at all with it. I have to go over all parts of my face and neck two or three times, stretching the skin in every way possible, and even then I still find areas that could have been closer.I really wanted to like this razor, especially because it's so expensive. I've had great Braun razors before, but this isn't one of them. I'm sorry that I can't agree with everyone else on this one.BTW, I'm sure that part of the reason this razor is so expensive is because Braun really overdid the packaging. You'd think the packaging was for some precious family heirloom or valuable jewels, not an electric razor.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"The turtle lights up and projects stars on the ceiling. That's it. We have the 'endangered species' version, so ours actually has 5 endangered animals on the shell that can be light with a backdrop of light (only lights up on the turtle, no projection) in addition to the 2 color projections of stars.The reality is that this is a very boring, very simple night light.

"This fits the 9 oz avent bottles. It works great and heats evenly everytime. You don't have to worry about how much water is left in the unit like you do some other models. This warmer uses all the water you put in. If taking breast milk out of fridge, their water amount is wrong. But it doesn't take long to figure out. Also the box says to wait at least 10 min before using again, but you can use it back to back. I breast feed during the night so I can't comment on the night light portion. I LOVE the coolers.I live where it gets triple digits and I can leave cooler in car while shopping and feel good about it. I had the little cooler pack bag type rhombus but they melted so fast! I bought a second one to keep in my trunk for when I visit grandma or anyone else. I originally bought because my husband has horrible patience and the stove top was not ideal for warming with a screaming baby, especially if he allowed it to get too warm. I feel absolutely comfortable having him use this warmer. Takes about 3 min for 6.5 oz bs like 8 on the stove",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"Whenever my daughter gets fussy, we put her in the papasan and she falls right asleep. The music and built-in mobile are great for the baby, she especially likes the domed mirror under the mobile.The only con I can think of is that the motor is not very strong for a big baby. I first saw the papasan in use with my cousin's daughter who weighed not even 6 lbs, and I thought, cool the baby can use this for a long time.Well my baby was born at 8 lbs 1 oz and from the start the motor had trouble swinging on the first setting. So we put it on the second setting for a while but now that she is 11 lbs, it can barely swing her. Even on the highest setting the swinging gradually slows down and once I even found the thing just sitting still and my poor daughter was sitting and just staring at the mobile overhead.Still with it's cons, I am grateful to have this thing to put my daughter in when I have to do something else.",baby products,gear,swings

"I have been using electric toothbrushes ever since the first Sonicare toothbrush came out when they were just selling them in infomercials. I have used the original Sonicare and the 2 models that came out after that and then I went to theOral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrushtoothbrush which I liked better than the Sonicare brushes. I used the first one until the battery died after about 2 years and I got another one and used it for about 2 years and I was completely happy with it. That is because I didn't know what I was missing. I had seen the great reviews on this toothbrush so I thought I would just try it out. I am glad I did. This is not a Sonic type toothbrush which I knew before I bought it so I was kind of skeptical but all my concerns were put to rest the first time I used it. It gives you the fresh feeling you have when you leave the dentist. My teeth are smooth and much cleaner than they ever were when using the sonic type of brush. Combine this toothbrush withCrest Weekly Clean Intensive Cleaning Toothpaste - 0.85 Ozand you can practically skip going to the dentist for your biannual cleanings.

"Please don't be fooled that this is a weightless ""answer in a bottle"". Alli is meant to supplement an exercise program along with a sensible eating plan. If you make the mistake into thinking that all you need do is take this product, and you will drop pounds, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. On the other hand, if you've committed to reducing your fat calories, and eating sensibly, the addition of this product will certainly allow you to lose three to five percent more weight. I guarantee, you will experience man adjustment phase. Once in which you will take the product and regulate how much fat you eat in a meal. In the initial learning phase, if you have not trimmed much of the fat from your meal, be ready for some soiled underwear. On the other hand, if you make the mistake of taking one of these pills in conjunction with a triple-decker hamburger, you better be wearing a ""Depends"". Eating sensibly, exercising then I have the chance, and taking Alli, I have lost 45-pounds since February. Despite being aware of the warnings, I too have had several accidents. Overall, it is a good product and performs as expected.

I saw this product and I figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did! I use tommy tippee bottles and they are wide and short and I wondered if two would even fit at one time, but they did! The only reason I gave 4 stars out of five is because after several weeks of using this I found that it doesn't stay cold the full 12 hours like it says.

It's very easy to use, only 30 minutes to set without a lot of mess and only requires a plastic bowl and water to activate. Excellent for a busy lifestyle and living on a budget. Only one note of caution - the entire line runs dark. I use medium chestnut brown on my dark brown hair and it turns it close to chocolate black. After 5-6 washings the colour relaxes into a rich, warm, very lovely and natural brown...but I have to suffer a little darkness to get there.

"We just got back from a trip from Orlando to Chicago using the travelmate and it was quite the success!! As another reviewer noted, I had many people stop me to ask where I got it, especially the jealous looking man who was lugging his toddlers seat on his back!! This carrier is a DREAM, I was traveling alone w/ my 19 month old son and he had his own seat on the plane (if your little one is riding on your lap, you can check this at the gate just as you would a stroller so you cal have it available at your destination gate) and I planned to rent a car at our destination, so I really needed to take his carseat, but couldn't imagine how I would manage a car seat, a stroller, our carry on and him with only my 2 hands. This was the perfect solution. I was able to leave the stroller home, and w/ him strapped into the seat I could just push him along and all I had to carry was my bag. Once we got the Chicago, I was able to pop the wheels off and put the seat w/ the carrier attached right into our rental car using the latch system. You can probably even leave the wheels on, but I felt this tilted the seat a bit forward and we had quite a ways to drive and I knew my son would be dozing, I didn't want him lolling forward, but that is a personal prefeence. The only issues I had w/ the carrier aren't the carriers fault, they are the airlines. In Orlando it fit right through the X-ray machine no problem, but in Chicago it was WAY too big. Unlike some other reviwers I did not have to take it apart though, the security guy just took it aside and swiped it with a wand (simimlar to what they would do w/ a wheelchair), if you have someone try to make you take your seat off the carrier, ask them to do this instead, it was no biggie and actually was a help as I had to put shoes back on me and my son so we needed a minute anyway. The other issue I had was on our plane, I could not roll my son down the aisle in the seat, it is too wide, even after taking the wheels off (I thought that would give me enough clearance & I could just drag him) it was too wide (I have the Alpha Omega Eddie Bauer seat, which is a monster, I admit) so I had to take him out of the seat and hustle him down to row 17 and carry the seat, which was a bit difficult as I am 5'2"", so I was pretty much carrying it over my head to clear the seats, but there was no way I could carry it that distance w/ my 25 lb son in it. It also would only fit in the seat w/ the wheels off, but that is no biggie, they pop right on and off. Coming home, I upgraded us to business class, and that was much easier, we were in the first row so I could roll the carseat that far and the seats were MUCH wider, I was able to put the seat in w/o taking the wheels off, if you can do this I would, it made it a snap to get in and out, I never had to take him out of the seat. We are going to NYC next month for a wedding and will take his seat and this carrier again, it was well worth the price for the ease of traveling!",baby products,car seats accessories,accessories

"Was not really impressed with this product. Cannot be cleaned at all because the little metal cymbols stain with the slightest bit of moisture. The petal holes above the cymbols inside are too tempting for kids (and their little siblings) to poke and hurt their fingers. It makes a loud sound, but rattles too much to make a decisive beat and teach anything about rhythm. It is now relegated to a toy bin, where it is generally ignored, because it's not much fun.

"My husband & I both really like this swing. We have a VERY collicy baby with acid reflux and we can usually get her to nap in this swing, plus it helps that she is not lying flat when she is sleeping. I like the different speeds so you can turn it up as the baby gets heavier. She really likes the side to side motion of the cradle, and she loves to watch the fish move around on the mobile. There is not much that makes my baby happy, but this swing does (and has for 4 months), so if I could give it more than 5 stars I would. We did drag a blanket from it when she was first born, to slow it down, but I'm sure that's just being over protective.I also have a close friend that has the same swing, she likes it very much as well.",baby products,gear,swings

"I bought these bubbles to be part of my daughter's fairy-themed birthday party. I envisioned little fairies, with wings and floral head wreaths, skipping around catching and holding bubbles. While the party was terrific, the bubbles were not. I think these are way overpriced for what they are. I did get the 5-pack, but the bubble blower is so tiny and makes such little bubbles. Ours did not stay bubbles for long, but I understand that may be related to the weather. Also, when they pop/deflate/whatever, the residue is pretty nasty. It's a thick, sticky film that's a little difficult to get off. I feel as if I threw away a chunk of money on this purchase and wish I had just gone to the grocery store and gotten cheap bottles of normal bubbles. The only positive thing I have to say about the catch a bubble is that the design of the container is very nice. It's easy for little hands to hold and the top is designed so that if it tips over, the stuff really doesn't all pour out.",toys games,novelty gag toys,unknown

"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box.

"This product is a must-have if you need to baby-proof a house. Much more convenient than the simple plastic plugs you can stick in outlets. You can plug and unplug as needed without needing a screwdriver to remove stuck plugs. The spring loaded mechanism is pretty tight making it very hard for an inventive and strong toddler to slide the cover aside. Even if the toddler is capable of that, it would not leave a free hand to actually stick anything in at the same time. With the cover on it is impossible to stick anything in.To install, just replace the face plate of the outlets with these. They cover the original outlets, so no rewiring is needed. Screws are supplied in case the original screws are too short to accommodate the slightly thicker plates.There are some flimsy competitive products out there. So I made sure to get sturdy ones.

Will see what they say. The last one started arcing where the plug goes into the pad, and they had me send that one back. I'm a little leary of getting another one of the same kind this time, even if offered.The replacements did come in a timely manner, within about 5 days, but noone can tell me why I keep getting the same code.

You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments.

I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain.

When I first applied it to my hair (wet), it felt super smooth, when rinsing it out, again, super smooth, but once my hair started to dry, it felt kind of, not so great. I thought to myself, ""Uh-oh!

The sandalwood is not my favorite but the ladies love it; and this is the one I reordered immediately. It is the purest I have come across. Just great stuff from one of America's classic companies.

She was not hurt (small red bump) but was very frightened (as were my husband and myself). Luckily we were both right there with her and were able to extract her from the chair very quickly.

I am glad that only small pieces come off, but two weeks later, she has chewed through to where the treats are held in place.

"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story.

The sounds are definitely white noise, and have very few bass tones which is what we were used to. I don't think it masks as well as the pink noise that we had, but it does help us sleep.

Used in TENS, IF and ultrasound units. Extremely dependable!Mine were packed & shipped well from Amazon, so I have to wonder if some reviews on ALL batteries purchased online have to do with damage in shipping... If not packed correctly (or if the shipping co beats them up), ANY batteries can be damaged and not work to specs, leak, etc! If you receive a damaged or poorly packed set of batteries, send them back & let the sender know they were not packed properly, or if damage is visible, call the carrier! If not packed well, order from someone who knows how to properly pack batteries for shipment!!! It doesn't mean the batteries are bad! These are the best non-rechargeables I've used by far!So, be sure to check the box & packing outside AND inside for damage before giving the battery a bad wrap!I also LOVE the bulk pack!

Neither during nor after pregnancy have I experienced any sickness in relation to them and have found them to be easy to take.To the reviewer who commented about having to take 5 per day - one-a-day vitamins are not all that helpful because your body can only take in what it is currently lacking. Thus, most of your vitamin will be wasted. Furthermore, these vitamins are generally synthetic, so they can squeeze more ""stuff"" into the vitamin, but your body doesn't absorb synthetics as well as natural vitamins. The reason you have to take 5 of these is because these are not synthetic - they are in fact natural (plant-derived) vitamins. If it's helpful, I take 3 with breakfast and 2 with dinner.

"I just used my Medela Harmony breastpump for the first time and was completely satisfied with the product! I also own the Medela In-Style Advanced double electric breastpump which I used while going to school full-time. However, now that I am staying home, I find it to be a big hassle to assemble the electric pump every time I need to express milk. My baby is starting to eat solids, and I just needed a pump for expressing enough milk to mix with baby cereal to feed her. The Medela Harmony was a convenient, effective option for doing this!Having never used a manual pump, I expected it to have a lot less suction power than my electric unit, and therefore, a lot more work. Not so! The suction power is controlled easily by how hard you sqeeze and allows a wide range of suction power. I especially liked that the handle rotates so I can use it from all different angles. Also, the package says that the pump body can be removed from the handle and attached to the Medela Symphony electric pump, which is nice that it's versatile. The pump has many of the same parts at my electric pump, like the yellow insert and the white membrane, so if I lose/break a piece, I now have back-ups, which is why I ultimately chose this product.The unit is simple to assemble/disassemble and easy to clean.

"I have always had small/tiny dogs that are house-trained as well as outdoor trained, so of course I have gone through an abundance of pee pee pads.These are of great quality. They are folded and packaged nicely, and when you unfold them, there is no tearing of the white absorbent part underneath (for some brands, when you unfold the wee wee pads, it will rip a little bit of the white absorbent part of the pee pee pad - not always a huge deal but it really shouldn't do that - and if it tears closer to the edge you might be a little concerned with some leakage).Also, for this brand, the white absorbency part of the pad is uniform throughout the whole pad. For some cheaper brands, you will occasionally find a bare spot in that padding - and although the blue part underneath is a little more liquidproof, I don't think it is failsafe. So it's better for the absorbent padding to be uniform.Happy when I can buy this brand!",pet supplies,dogs,litter housebreaking

"This is my first set of hot rollers. I have shortish (just below my jawline) hair that is really resistant to curling. Ever since I got seriously burned on the neck as a child with a curling iron I haven't liked those, but I love the ""big volume"" look curling gives my hair. I got these as an inexpensive way to try out hot rollers and I really liked them. They are very easy to use - they heat quickly, but don't get so hot that they're difficult to handle. They gave my hair great bounce and volume that lasted all the way through an evening wedding, something that has been difficult for me to achieve with velcro rollers or a hairbrush and a blowdryer.A couple of notes about these:- They do take a bit of practice. There's a row of comb-like teeth on one side to grab your hair. You need to use small sections of hair - smaller than you might think. At first my hair wasn't rolling onto the rollers, then I tried using thinner, smaller sections of hair and they worked with no trouble. I have fairly fine, stick-straight hair and with practice I was able to get these to work perfectly. If you have very coarse, straight hair you may need to try a velour-covered roller (which these aren't) to get your hair to ""grab"" the roller.- Unless you have a lot of experience, forget the roller pins that come with the set and get a set of Conair roller clips (also sold on Amazon) to use with the set. The Conair clips cover the rollers perfectly, hold the rollers tightly, and don't make you want to tear your hair out from frustration, like the pins will.- If you're looking for very hot heat from rollers (or need it to get your hair to curl) these may not be the best choice. They do heat up but it's not really REALLY hot, like I've seen described with other rollers. The amount of heat worked great for my hair (curled without damage) but very, very resistant hair might need more heat than these provide. I liked this amount of heat because I could handle the rollers without fear of burning myself, or fear of frying my hair crispy.All in all, I really liked these rollers. Easy to learn with, and I love that they're portable and not too large in diameter (better for use with shorter hair).",beauty,hair care,styling tools

It has no auditory component at all, so all you have is a simple memory game with Spanish words. Would have been a great item if it had been part of Leap Frog Tag or Tag Junior.

"Used this product for about a month and a half. After having regular constipation sometimes no go for 4 or 5 days leading to strenuous bloody stools. I'm male and mid 30s. For the first week or 2 no big changes in stool however I immediately noticed better sleep and dreams. The changes in stools started around 3 weeks after taking them with softer more regular stools. Now about 30 days later I'm completely regular going 1 - 2 times a day taking 2 capsules (3 recommended) a night. This product also has pro biotics in the capsules as well. I personally recommend this product to anyone dealing with constipation or even problems sleeping as something natural that can be taken indefinitely resulting in being regular. Plus, it's not challenging to take, I keep mine in my medicine cabinet and take 2 before I brush my teeth before bed. Some pro biotics and cleansers I've taken have you take them before meals and/or after meals or 2 - 3 times a day etc. And other products I've tried on the web seem to be promoted by the company selling them. At least on amazon.com it seems to be one of the few places where you can still find valid opinions on products as they are selling many different brands and products and making money on them all and not the only one they sell.

"My son has repeatedly declared over the past six months that he wants to be an inventor when he grows up, so we bought this toy for his seventh birthday a few weeks ago. Since then, both he and his nine-year-old sister have played with the Snap Circuits set several times. I'm particularly impressed with the set because my son doesn't have the longest of attention spans, and I didn't know if he would be interested enough to remain focused on completion of a project on his own. I've been pleasantly surprised.The tasks start out easy and increase in complexity as you move through the projects in the instruction book. The pieces are labeled clearly, which makes it easy for my son to see what he needs next. I think part of the reason he remains interested is that he sees the payoff such as a light or alarm coming on, music being played when he claps or makes a noise, or flicking a switch to move from a light to a noise. I very much like the snap feature, because the pieces are easy for my kids to attach or take apart without my assistance.As for the educational aspect, the instruction book contains some explanations and ""now try this"" suggestions. Unless my husband or I work on the project with my son, he tends to gloss right over the explanations. Older kids might get a bit more out of the explanations bit.Bottom line--if your child is interested in science, this is a good and relatively inexpensive intro set that allows independent play.",toys games,learning education,science

"I got this system based on the stellar reviews here. Now that I have been using it for a few months now, I feel there are some definite pros and cons to this system.Pros-* Smells do seem to be well-contained.* Liner refills last a while.* Easy to change/dispose liners.* Simple, unobtrusive design- doesn't clash with room's decor.Cons-* Maybe this is just a problem in my area (Boston)- I can't find the liners for sale anywhere- only online. I have to make sure I am not running low. Not a huge issue, because the liners last- I usually place an order when I get to my last liner refill and have plenty of time to receive it via regular shipping. Despite the fact I have only had to order one box of refills since baby was born, it's still inconvenient.* While the pedal/trap door disposal is super convenient, I find it only works properly if the bag inside is empty and the diaper I am tossing is fairly heavy. When my baby was a newborn, I had to push the diaper through the trapdoor- the diapers, even soiled, we not heavy enough to fall through the trap door. And if the bag is half full, it might just fall in half way- so you have to give it a push in, down towards a bunch of dirty diapers...eeeww...Annoying.* This one has been mentioned before",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

I was absolutely delighted to finally find it again, unchanged.It's a shame that the product has such an awful name. It's not that it isn't any good for stretch marks, it absolutely rocks. But it makes your skin feel just wonderful and soft, without being greasy. I've even had people comment on the softness of my skin. It makes a great face cream as well, and even smells great. And a small amount goes a long way, so don't let the price scare you, it's worth every penny, and more.I realize I sound like a commercial, but I looked for this for so long without success, I can't help being enthusiastic. I also want others to find this and buy it, so it stays on the market where it belongs. Do try it, not just for stretch marks, but for dry skin, or just general moisturizing. I promise, you'll be glad you did!",health personal care,health care,massage relaxation

"Truthfully, this game is not what I assumed it to be when I bought it; the moles do not pop their heads out of the ground like the Whac-A-Mole games at the arcade, but rather, simply flash when you need to hit them.This was a reasonably fun game for our 2 1/2 year old for the first couple of weeks but he soon grew bored of it.The default setting is not terribly challenging, although it does have an hard mode where your only queue to hit the moles is via a sound, which unfortunately, as the game is either too hard to or too easy, seems to be targeted to a older child.",toys games,games,board games

They fit her better than the other brands that we have tried, and we have had only a little bit of trouble with leaking, but that has been almost only at night, and with very soggy diapers.

"I, unfortunately, seem to have peasant feet--leathery soles with sandpaper heels that get deep cracks almost overnight. I keep a pumice stone in the shower and use it daily, but in the summer my feet seem to get even worse. And recently I bought a pair of Chaco sandals to wear while taking our dog on 2 mile walks and well, everywhere, really. I'm living in them. The Chacos (also purchased at Amazon for a great price) are VERY comfortable--but I did notice almost immediately that my heels seemed to be REALLY callusing/cracking--so much that I Googled the problem--and it's a common problem among Chaco wearers but not a deal breaker. So--what to do about the calluses? Found the Denco Professional Foot smoother on Amazon, read the reviews, thought--why not? Let's see if it really IS different/better.In a word--YES. It IS different. I have an egg, the razor thing (that really CAN be dangerous,) another cheese grater like thing, a variety of Pumice stones from serious rock like to the softer Mr. Pumice--The Denco leaves them all behind. I used it on my dry feet before my shower--working over the trashcan to collect the dust--and then I used it again after my shower. My heel cracks are so deep that it is going to take some time before they can be completely fixed--and you do need to be careful--my heel was a little tender around the most severe heel crack--but it was already there, so not the Denco product's fault. I have some of the callus remover lotion on order and look forward to using it with the Denco Smoother to help my heels. But for now--I LOVE this product.",beauty,tools accessories,nail tools

Maybe because this stuff is actually made under license in the US.The flavors are good--vibrant, but not so sugary sweet that you find your throat hurting (unlike, say, the fruit flavored Twizzler varieties).

"So far, I have also tried three types of wavers the revlon 3 barrel waver, gold and hot waver from sally's beauty supple, and the infiniti deep waver. The revlon waver made dents in my hair as if I had my hair in a ponytail all day and the gold and hot waver did minor dents in my hair and it did even wave at all. I was surprise that the first two deep wavers did not work on my hair because I have very fine thin asian hair. I had a picture in my mind of how I thought the waves would look like.

It makes the perfect s shape waves like you french braided your hair and slept with it over night and if you flip the waver the opposite way and began waving your hair it would looked as if you hair had hollywood glamour curl shaped/ waves. The waves lasts about 1 to 2 days.

"I started buying Choline Chloride after reading research into ""smart drugs"" (compounds to enhance cognitive function) some years ago. The theory with Choline Chloride is that it increases the body's access to the chemical building blocks of the neurotransmitter Acetyl Choline and that this access produces an increase in some measures of intellectual ability.Whether or not this works is largely subjective. Its effects are subtle and might be the result of the placebo effect. I only know that when I use it, I tend to write more and faster than when I don't, and that one co-worker who tried it said it gave her the feeling of being ""detached"" or ""disengaged.""Interestingly enough, the liquid form of the compound that you find here is not the only form. Twinlabs offers a powdered form of the compound (""choline cocktail"") to which they add caffeine and various other things in a way that seems not altogether honest. That is, if the actual compound you're paying for has real efficacy on its own, why should the manufacturer have to ramp up the effects with energy-boosting components?I like the liquid version I review here and I prefer it because Vitamin Research at least trusts their product to function on its own without augmentation.

"Honestly, I just had to give a review of this toy, because I was reading some of the others that complained that this toy was poorly made. Well, it is not.I have seen tons of these Hot Wheels sets, and this is the most fun, most durable, most non ugly (not orange) playset that I have seen. Many of these track type things have these tiny pieces, that if you lose one, the whole set is garbage. This set has no small pieces that you can lose.It folds up into a suitcase , and has clips on the edges to keep it together when it is folded for easy transport. When you first un-fold it, it sometimes comes apart, but not because it is poorly made... it is WELL made. What happens is Mattel designed it to come apart at it's joints, to prevent people from ""accordion"" folding it in the wrong direction and thereby snapping it and breaking it. Instead of breaking when it is improperly folded up... or folded out... it comes apart. It can be EASILY EASILY EASILY snapped together again, with large ball in loop clips that any moron could easily put back together. THe track is 6 feet long, and it is easy to get confused when unfolding it, especially for a little kid, so this ""come apart"" safeguard is sensible, in my opinion. When it is in use, it never comes apart, not at any joint.Once it is stood up, there is a sweet spot. Where the tall support sort of clicks into it's proper position. Once it's in position, the set NEVER falls down. We have had our track for 3 years, from my son being 2 - 5 years of age... and it has never come apart or fallen down while he was playing with it.It has numbers to tell you which car wins, which I LOVE, because little kids like to cheat. This way they can't. Also, the starting gate is fair, because there is a release button, that releases all four cars at the same time, so no car gets a head start. It's fun to have Dad, Mom and my son all pick a car... and then race. We have raced ALL of our cars and found that our 1995 ambulance is the fastest (who'd of thunk it?).The reason I bought this track in the first place is... when my son was 2, we were visiting a friend who's 5 year old had this track. They both played with it for hours. I knew my son would love to have his own. And... I should mention, that the child we were visiting is not gentle with his toys, and his father commented to me how it is the only HotWheels set he's had that has held up to his son's abuse.It is hard to find, but I continually make the effort to buy this for other parents who have kids that are into Matchbox and Hotwheels cars. My child still plays with it, and every time he gets a new car from someone, the first thing he wants to do is see if it is faster or slower than some of his others...so out the track comes!Maybe some people have defective sets, but more likely, the parents having trouble are not bothering to set it up and stand it up properly.The second leg support is removable, but ours has never come off by accident, but that is a part that could be lost I suppose, but it is large, so unlikely.I highly recommend this toy! I generally hate Hot Wheels playsets of all kinds, I prefer the matchbox ones. But his one is the BEST!",toys games,vehicles remote control,vehicle playsets

"I was always curious about wax for my facial hair. My mother warned me a long time ago not to tweeze the hair on my chin and upper lip, but I didn't listen. As a result, the hair on my chin and face grew back faster, thicker, longer, and darker- I was screwed. Throughout the years I've been tweezing and using cream hair remover once or twice a week; until I thought about using wax. I just started waxing today, it was a bit messy but I quickly got the hang of it. One thing's for sure- It'd HURT LIKE HELL!!! Especially pulling the wax off of the upper lip area. But the end result was well worth the tears! I am smooth and hair free! I will do a follow-up on how long it takes for my hair to grow back! No Pain, No Gain! ;')**UPDATE!** I know, it's been a while! But after a few uses, my skin stayed hairless for about a week and a few days. It gave me a little bit of a break but I think I will look for something better. Based on my results, I give this product three stars out of five.",beauty,bath body,unknown

I took off one star for fun since the wheel on the rolling ship doesn't spin well (I'm not sure if it was supposed to) and I was sorta hoping for a land plate with some trees on it or something. I gave it three stars for educational values since it helps with construction and motor skills (and also helps to build future legos) but it wouldn't really help in life. It is really tough and won't break easily; the only reason I gave it two for durability is because the big wheel ship fell off my table and exploded into Lego oblivion, but I was able to rebuid it.

"This helicopter is a great little toy for the curious beginner. On my first use I was impressed with this choppers abilities for the price I got it for and my nearly five year old daughter absolutly loves to watch me fly it. That being said, mine has consistently required the use of the ""trim"" button on the remote. It makes adjustments to the tail rotor motor to correct out of control spinning. I have found that I have to trim on almost every liftoff which is why I am giving this four stars and not five. Also, because I have to trim so much I have found that this limits the ability for the chopper to turn being that the left/right controls are different being how much I have it trimmed. In other words one direction requires only a slight tap on the controls to turn and the other direction requires a much harder stick movement. I have also tried to adjust the tail as the directions state but that did not work. This is only a small annoyance so please don't allow this minor complaint of mine to deter you from buying it. Another thing to keep in mind is that florescence lights can have an effect on the infer red communications. I took it to work to show my fellow co-workers and had to kill the lights completely to get it to function so if you chopper is not responding or it has problems dropping out of the air try reducing or turning off the lights.By the way, as one reviewer mentioned the TV commercial I have to agree and also say that that commercial is a complete joke! If you haven't seen it it shows kids whipping their choppers around as if they were paper airplanes as well as having them fly quickly under obstacles and picking up objects with a hook of some sort. I would love to have them use the chopper I bought for that commercial! This chopper in general is a slow flying durable fun alternative to expensive outdoor models.

"This is now the only true sports drink. I realized how much of a crock Vitamin Water was shortly after that craze started. I feel like it is an injustice to O Water to compare it to Vitamin Water. O Water was created by one of the Tom's (one of the ""Juice Guys"" that co-founded Nantucket Nectars) and is quickly catching on in cities such as Boston (flagship) and San Francisco. The product is 100% natural and does not have an absolute surplus of vitamins and minerals that just pass through your body because they are supplied in such great abundance. Heres a quick and typical comparison between O Water and Vitamin Water:Sugars = 9g (cane sugar) compared to 13g (sucrose)Cal = 35 compared to 50There is also no artificial colors, preservatives or anything!Where Vitamin Water uses artificial preservatives, O Water only uses natural preservatives such as rosemary oil extract. Simply put, O Water is truly a healthy sports drink that you can enjoy with no shame. For those of you that are on a stricter diet, There is a regular version of O Water, that is simply flavored water with 0 cal. Try some!!!!! Coconut and Blueberry are my favorite Infused O Waters.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks
"I just bought this toy for my sons, ages 3 and 6. My six year old absolutely loves it! He has no problem following the directions the toy ""speaks"" out. You have to follow the directions in order for the game to work the right way. And this is actually a game which I didn't really know when I bought. YOu have to ""battle"" to win in each of the 4 environments. Once you have won in all 4 areas you are the winner. My three year old really likes it to but it is more difficult for him to follow the directions. When I help him it's no problem and he does enjoy it. He does just play around with it his own way though so he could care less about the directions. He doesn't exactly understand it though. I do think it would be better for at least a 4yr old, probably a 5yr old. My 6yr old can play it without any help from an adult which I like. If you buy this make sure to buy some more figures to go along with it. It comes with two but the outcome would basically be the same over and over. The other figures come in sets of two and they are not expensive. WE have 6 total which gives the boys 12 halves. This gives them lots of options.

"Being a game enthusiast I did not bat an eye when I saw Coodju and realized it was a spelling game, I am not a great speller but the game looked groovy and I was looking for something new. I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. Coodju lives up to it's promise to be the best new party game. After playing it at home with my family I decided to take it to a friend's party this past weekend. In the wake of recent events we all needed some tension release and good old-fashioned fun. We all played on the ferry ride over to our desitnation and we were so animated that others on the ferry who were not in our group asked to join in. It felt really great to meet new people and enjoy smiles and laughs. Coodju is easy to learn and exteremly simple in concept so in minutes our group grew from 4 to 8. Later on at the party we once again pulled out Coodju and had a rousing game with the other party-goers. I ended up leaving Coodju with the host as a gift - everyone really loved playing and said it added a great element to an already fun party. I recommend Coodju for parties and for families looking for a new and different game. It is great fun and you may actually learn a thing or two. What I also realized is that Coodju is a great gift alternative (house-warming or otherwise). I hope everyone enjoys Coodju as much as my friends and I do.",toys games,grown up toys,unknown

"Much to the chagrin of my husband, I am the kinda gal that can't sleep without white noise. It used to be a big box fan in our bedroom, but as anyone who sleeps with a fan on knows, that dries you out super quick - doubly so when your house is dry to begin with. Plus there's the old ""stuff a sock under the carry handle to keep the fan from rattling"" and heaven help you if it ever gets a rattle that you can't get rid of!I love the SleepMate! My husband finally said ""No more FAN!"" and so I purchased a SleepMate instead. I was dubious at first- I have a very specific kind of white noise that I like to have when I sleep and I was thinking there's no WAY this tiny thing could ever make a sound to compare to the box fan! However, like other reviewers have said this thing can be LOUD! There's two speed settings - high and low - and the top and side of the SleepMate rotate, which covers and uncovers holes to change the pitch and tone of the loud ""WHRRRRR"" sound it makes. It doesn't matter how picky you are about your white noise, I'll bet you can find a tone that you like if you fiddle long enough.

"I bought one of these three years ago and a second one a few months ago. One is in our bedroom and other in our daughter's, they both work great.Read the instructions. They explain that you must add salt to the water, the exact amount will depend on your water, but you'll figure it out after a few uses. I add a little shy of 1/4 teaspoon and the humidifier runs quietly from when we go to bed until morning. If I'm heavy handed with the salt then it gurgles a little and it runs out of water before we wake but it's not a big deal. If I was scant on the salt then it puts out less steam.I only have two complaints. One is there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off. Second, there is still an inch or so of water in the reservoir when the water is too low for it to emit steam. The unit works best if you dump this out and start fresh every night. As other reviewers have noted (and as mentioned in the instructions), there are black mineral flecks in the remaining water. I just dump it in the toilet and refill the reservoir (and add salt). It seems all the affordable humidifiers have some convenience flaw. This humidifier is so affordable, these two complaints are so minor I obviously bought a second one.You can't tell from the picture, but you can rotate the blue part to any direction (it houses all the inner workings and vents the steam). It's a super simple design that works. If you find the blue part ""floats,"" then you've over-filled it past the mark on the reservoir.Our apartment is cold and drafty. These humidifiers definitely make the bedrooms feel warmer. It doesn't so much change the air temperature as make the air more comfortable.If you want a fancy humidifier, this isn't it.

I use light ash brown for my dark brown hair. I use it only on the grays. I am 46 and graying slowly however some spots tend to stick out more then others. I pick thru my hair and use bobby pins to pull out the gray spots. Then I mix one tablespoon of each of the color mixes into a dish and use that small amount on only my grays. The color matches my hair great. In the end its perfect and after a couple washes my grey look like highlights. That's the look IM after..

It turned the dye a dark purple/black like the other reviews mentioned, and I only used 5 drops, which is much less than they say to use. I could tell a difference as soon as my hair dried- my hair was lighter than I've ever been able to take it, but instead of seeing more orange or red, I saw much less- I look closer to a blonde instead of a strawberry blonde.

"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.

"GREAT BANANA FLAVOR AND SMELL = is banana flavored and scented and the little bunnies just love it! I also use it for a treat for my older rabbits - and it never hurts to give pre- and pro-biotics to growing or nursing adult rabbits.NOT PELLETED = no hard dry compress pellets, but chopped up hay, pressed into alphabet shapes. Cute. The bunnies can't really appreciate the effort put into letter shaped food, but if you have children helping to feed the rabbits, this goes over very well. It's like Alphabet cereal for bunnies!GREAT FOR DIGESTION = has pre-biotics and pro-biotics in the formula that help to build up the beneficial bacteria in the delicate digestive system of rabbits.GREAT FOR WEANING RABBITS = you can mix this product with formula or water and microwave it to heat and soften it. Tiny babies won't have a hard time trying to chew hard food with their tiny teeth. The smell and the good taste of this product made from fresh green hay make this product great. There is nothing else on the market that even comes close!GREAT FOR HAND-FEEDING = Recently, I was given 3 tiny baby cottontails to raise. They were found on a construction site and had to be removed (too bad they couldn't wait 2 weeks!). I had read that cottontails that are taken from the mother in the first few days after birth are very susceptible to intestinal problems and get diarhea from eating anything once they are weaned - some immediately, some later. This phenomena is caused by the rabbit having an almost sterile gut - no good bacteria to aid in digestion and keep away the bad bacteria.ONE NEGATIVE = only comes in the small sized bag. I would like to purchase by the 25 lb bag, but it is not available in larger sizes.WARNING = If you are hand-feeding tiny baby bunnies that do not have their eyes open yet, PLEASE NOTE - rabbit formula does NOT have enough protein for developing bunnies. A lack of dietary protein for newborn bunnies can cause blindness and vision problems due to cataracts. Contact your nearest wildlife center for information on adding protein to your formula.I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT(multiple times) - Highly Recommended!My bunnies and I just can't imagine life without Jr. Bunny!",pet supplies,bunny rabbit central,food

"I am very concerned about the safety of this Britax/Regal Boulevard Seat. I had the seat for just over a month and I found my child seated with the straps loosened and completely off his shoulders four times after our journey home. I finally figured out that he just pulls on the quick release tap in front of him (under a cloth flap) and leans over; thus loosening the straps with the utmost ease. He is 3 years 1 month old.Thank God I was not in an accident during the 4 times his straps were off his shoulders!!!!Other than this ""flawed"" design feature, I find the seat quite nice given your car has ample rear seat space.

"Normally I wouldn't review a product like this because I don't want people to use it as advice instead of relying on their vet. But that being said, when my 16-year old German Shepherd started experiencing severe problems with her arthritis, I found the vet's advice less than expert and searched the web. The glucosamine supplement the vet prescribed just wasn't working, so he recommended putting down my dog. Now, I am not crazy, I know sixteen years is ancient for a shepherd and if I thought my dog was unable to live a happy full life, I would make the tough decision, but I didn't feel like we had explored all options.Anyway, we ordered cosequin DS and within a WEEK, my shep went from being unable to stand, walk down her ramp to the front yard, or even squat to do her business, to actually getting up to wake me in the morning, wandering about her yard and going as she pleases. I am so thankful we found and tried this product because she is a beautiful, healthy dog. She doesn't run like a puppy but trust me, when your dog can't even use her back legs, seeing her walk unaided is enough to make you excited. It may not work for every dog, but it has been absolutely amazing for us. The vet is amazed by her progress, I'm amazed, my dog is amazed :)I should mention my sheperd has severe arthritis and liver issues, but has had no side effects.

Prior to finding this product, my cat had started to become anti-social, probably due to the fact that every time I managed to track her down she was being traumatized by being pinned down and having a pill shoved down her throat... now, if I am not right on time when it comes to giving her a pill, she is the one who lets me know now by meowing and making noise until she gets her pill.One suggestion... if your cat is not accustomed to receiving treats, I would introduce them to treats for about a week or two before introducing these. My cat was skeptical of treats, because she never got them, so I started giving her Temptations cat treats about two weeks before starting the pill pockets. It got her used to the idea of receiving treats daily, and after a short amount of time she was gobbling the treats without even chewing. Made it much easier when I introduced her to the pill pockets - she ended up just gobbling those down too without chewing, so she doesn't even notice there is a pill buried inside.

"After reading the reviews on these, I was confused. One reviewer said it was too small for her kids, another said it was too big. I figured I needed to find out for myself, so I took a chance and purchased one. I'm pleasantly surprised. I have 3 kids, ages 7, 5 and 1. I originally intended to purchase 3, but I think I'll go with 2 for now. This will definitely be too big for the baby, and I don't think she'd be able to use it as intended until she's at least 2 or 3. By that time my oldest MAY have outgrown it. I have skinny kids with thin necks and regular-sized heads. These will be perfectly sized for them. I suppose if you have an enormous 9-year old this might be too small, but I think an adult could even use it if they needed to.I love the softness of the pillow, and the fact that it's machine washable. People drool when they sleep. Especially kids. I couldn't believe that some of the competing products out there were surface-wash only fabric. What were they thinking? I love all of the different animals, I had a hard time choosing, but finally chose the pink hippo and the green alligator. Adorable!I only gave the product 4-stars because it is made in China, and I think something like this could have just as easily been made in Europe or North America, and I wouldn't have to worry about what kind of chemicals it might have been sprayed with. I'm definitely going to wash mine before I let the kids use them.

I like the fact that it is one solid piece without moving parts, which I have come to realize is an important safety feature. The bars are close together and the mattress fits snugly. Aesthetically, I like the way it looks and the curvature of the legs.The assembly is straightforward, but I would use two people so one can hold up one side while the other person assembles the other.Adjusting the height of the mattress is a bit cumbersome, as you must unscrew and dislodge the frame. However, I don't know of any crib that is easier and you only have to do it a few times over the course of a couple of years.The only major negative is that the wood is soft and the paint chips off rather easily. I have found teethmarks on my daughter's crib. So, you might want to invest in a rubber teething protector.I have not converted the crib into a toddler bed yet, so I cannot comment regarding that. As a crib, though, it does the job for a reasonable price.",baby products,nursery,furniture
The larger wheels are easy to use on carpeted floors and the bag beneath the seat is great for transporting items. Height adjustment is very good. The over all quality control is adequate but could be better. It is not as easy to fold as some other walkers and is difficult to get in the back seat of some vehicles; thus the 4 stars instead of 5.,health personal care,medical supplies equipment,mobility aids equipment

"I have extremely oily and fine hair and it becomes flat very quickly unless I have the right shampoo.

"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She loved the lights & sounds as well as the ""books"" on activity center and had no problem turning the swivel chair to play. Eventually (7 months) she became bored with sitting in the chair and started pulling up on the activity center to play while she would stand on the outside. I never had a problem with it losing its stability or tipping over. My husband then took it apart to create the walker and she loved it as well; getting upset when we became too tired to keep turning her around when she would hit a wall. This toy is what played a huge role in her learning how to walk and she was walking on her own by 8 months old. She still enjoys sitting in the middle of the activity center and playing while on the floor. Then only issue I had was a piece of the locking mechanism that keeps the activity center on the base, broke when trying to create the walker. We didn't need it anymore but I was disappointed when it broke so easily. Other than that... a great buy and worth every penny.",toys games,baby toddler toys,unknown

"I am always looking for foods that have not been altered in any way. I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper. They all popped completely, and perfectly with this organic brand.I also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison. As far as popping completely, this brand won. The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method. There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand. There were none with this organic brand. The size of the popcorn were both equal, but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand, yet they didn't seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other. Flavor was good, but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it. The texture was different from the store bought version as well. It was less ""light"" and a bit more chewy in texture. Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version, or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcorn.I will be purchasing more of this brand. I was somewhat concerned about the packaging, but relieved to find that it comes with its' own ziplock sealer, so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh.

"I have fair skin that tends to burn very easily, so I am very careful about my sunscreen. I had heard great things about this sunscreen, and I originally ordered the SPF 45 on Amazon, but it never arrived. So, I ended up buying bottles of it at my local grocery store.My initial conclusion? The sunblock was fantastic!It wasn't too oily, as far as high SPF sunscreens go, and it absorbed into my skin within minutes, leaving a soft (almost powdery) finish. It didn't flake off or look ghastly white at SPF 45 either, though the SPF 55 did both. It did look a bit shiny, which I found strange since it felt powdery, but, honestly, most people couldn't tell I was wearing sunscreen, even though I generally caked it on.I did notice (having purchased the SPF 55 and the SPF 45) that the higher the SPF the thicker and oiler the sunscreen got. The SPF 55 felt MUCH heavier than the SPF 45.Unfortunately, the SPF 45 started to make my skin sting when I put it on, and the SPF 55 absolutely made my skin burn. At first, I thought it was because my skin was getting sensitive from my retinol night cream, but I tried using the sunscreen after I'd discontinued using the cream, and it still left my skin stinging and irritated. In fact, the last time I used the SPF 55, it left my skin blotchy and red for days, particularly around my eyes. The SPF 45 hasn't left my skin feeling as painful, but still leaves it sensitive to the touch and super easily irritated/irritable.Maybe I'm just allergic or my skin doesn't agree with something in this product, but I would be careful.

"**Edit 09/12/2012**The leash finally snapped about 2 feet from the end (the dog end).Can't say I didn't expect it to happen eventually, just be aware that for a dog who tends to put tension on the rope regularly, that this leash may only last 6-7 months.I think I might just get some chain link.(minus one star because it broke)I'm purchasing this leash because our previous tie-out leash, also made of a braided cord, snapped. Luckily we still have a dog to let out (he likes to run).Comparing to the other tie-out I got from Menard's (similar ones at other home improv. stores), this one is definitely a step up.The quality of the latches is much nicer, and actually much easier to snap on and take off.There is a spring that seems to be for reducing torque on the dogs neck when he gets too far off the line, a neat feature, though I'm not sure how much of a difference this really makes (no real explanation on the included paperwork).As for the quality of the braided cord, this is something we'll have to wait on.

I have used this for 2 years and it is the only hair styling gel/spray I use. It takes me 5 seconds to do my hair and that is great! It adds texture to your hair so you barely have to do anything to style and make it look good. Very easy to make it work well! One can of gel also lasts a very long time since you only need a small amount of gel for each use. It is the strongest gel I have ever used (it could hold up a small mohawk).An IMPORTANT NOTE though on how to use it,beauty,hair care,styling products
"*****Echinacea is supposed to be good for your immune system, especially for prevention before you come down with a cold or flu; I am not sure of all of the uses, but I can tell you that this echinacea is great! First of all, is certified to be 400 mg of echinacea. It is organic, made from the stem, leaf, and flowers of echinacea purpurea (1200 mg). You are supposed to take three of these capsules three times a day, so that's nine capsules per day or twenty days worth total.What I liked best about this product is that it's really fresh--the bottle I ordered from this vendor did not expire for over 4 1/2 years. Since I don't take echinacea all the time but mostly when I'm around someone who is sick, I want something that isn't going to expire in a few months.Recommended.*****",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"I had this seat for 3 weeks and thought it looked so comfortable for my 9 month old. It was also nice looking. However, when my tiny 109 lb. 5'3&quot; mother(hardly capable of the brute strength it takes to break a sturdy part), was putting my baby in her carseat, the plastic piece that the shoulder straps go through(across the chest) before buckling, just broke. It broke around the hole that the left strap threaded through. If it broke in my mother's delicate hands, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF MY BABY HAD BEEN IN AN IMPACT IN THIS SEAT?!!!!! When we called Cosco to try to get a refund, all they offered was a replacement piece. The cust. serv. lady said that the piece isn't really necessary. I ask, why is the piece on the carseat if it is not necessary? After arguing with her, she finally admitted that this piece being broken does lessen the effectiveness of the carseat and increases my baby's chances of injury. Cosco still would not offer to refund the money I paid (I have the original receipt)for the carseat and only offered to send the replacement part via 2 day mail. You'd think they would atleast offer to overnight it, considering I explained to her that it is the only carseat I have and my baby has had to ride in it with this part broken. I will not be exchanging this seat for another Alpha Omega. If the part broke, a replacement part will be of the same poor quality and my baby's life is worth ALOT more than that.

"The PowerMop replaces a sponge mop, not a regular mop, in terms of what it can do. If you currently use a sponge mop, you will love this, as it solves the sponge mop problem (the dirty sponge that is hard to clean and expensive to replace). If you use a regular mop, this will be a disappointment. It is, however, much lighter and less effortful than a regular mop. If you have a few additional tools, and a fairly small surface area to clean (as in an apartment), you may want to consider it.Those with more than 200 sq. ft. of flooring to clean probably need to stick with more conventional means.In a nutshell, the Pros:-great for light cleaning of small spaces-fits well with a cleaning routine based on a Roomba-fits around toilets and costs less than Scooba, even with the supplies-great replacement for a sponge mop-carry a bottle of 409 with you, and many of the stained spots will come cleanThe Cons:-easy jobs are easy with the power mop, but difficult jobs are still difficult (it does not solve all problems)-need to go over the floor (quickly) multiple times for effective cleaning-disposable parts are expensive-cleaning solution is not the best possible-unlike their competitor, they don't allow you to refill the solution bottle with whatever you like-will require multiple pads for large floors, making it significantly more expensive for a house than an apartmentThe floor does need to be swept or, better, vacuumed before it is mopped. We have a Roomba, and so I find it convenient to send the Roomba around the kitchen first (while I'm doing something else), and then come back to mop afterwards. Those of you already in the habit of vacuuming your hard floors before you mop will have to do the same step.The power mop works best for me in multiple quick steps, rather than going over each piece of floor until it is completely clean. Quickly run the mop while squirting over the whole floor, then come back around again. The extra time allows the dirt to loosen up, so it's more efficient than going over each spot multiple times before moving on. This is very different than how most people mop, so it requires a change in habits.There is no heaviness, no bending, no dirty water, no smearing dirt around, and each step is very, very fast.",health personal care,household supplies,cleaning tools
"A rollator walker is something I have wanted for years and years. They were always out of my reach because of the cost. I'd seen less expensive models in various catalogs, but after having exposure to one probably made by Invacare, nothing else seemed to meet the standard I'd set in my mind.While I would have preferred the more deluxe model with a padded seat, and backrest, this one fit my budget. It's the first time I've seen one with such an easy-to-take price tag, and I jumped on it.While I will cover this in my comment regarding the seller, I want to say that I ordered the rollator at about 6:00AM, on 1/11/07, and it was here in my home on 1/12/07. THAT is service!Unpacking it was a little difficult for me alone, due to my disability, and the weight of the rollator. But I'm fairly strong and wrestled it out of the box, much to my relief, because I really wanted to see, touch, admire, and bond with my new legs immediately. (I have been using 2 canes for more years than I want to think about. I'm anxious to cut way back on needing them. This is the elegant solution.)After the unveiling, and the fumbling assembly of the Teal Blue Wonder, I took off. I roved around my place getting the feel of it, figuring out what I can and can't do in using it, and discovered the seat to be rather hard, but okay.The seat",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,mobility aids equipment

I have a 4 yr old beagle/doxin dog. That little muscular 20 pound dog would pull me forever on a walk as he tried to smell and eat everything around him. He tried on the collar twice for fitting and at a later date went for a walk. If he tried to pull he would stop immediately. I don't know if this collar would have bothered him as a puppy since he was scared of new things. But as a young adult is works great! I would have paid over $300 for the results it provides.

"When I ask you to identify a board game that is a strategic puzzle game for two players that also involves dexterity, what game pops into your well-informed head? Would it, perhaps, be Batik?You know, Batik, that lovely, wooden, puzzle-looking game in the Gigamic collection - yes, that collection of wooden strategic games available in the US from Fundex Games.Batik, the puzzle game designed by Kris Burmin, in which two players take turns dropping two different colors of wooden, tangram-like pieces into a wood and plexiglass frame.One of the most self-explanatory games around, especially for those who've played Connect Four. Even those who've played with Connect Four, just to see what happens, like a checker-dropping 3-year-old.See, when it's your turn, especially in the beginning of the game, it's not just a question of dropping any old shape into the frame. First of all, you have to pick a strategically significant shape (big? pointy? tiny? smooth?), and you have to get it to land pretty much just where you want it to land, somewhere preferably snug, or not, 'cause you often win by taking up more, rather than less space. And there's just a tad of luck, too. Taking turns, using any piece you want (unless you're playing the official ""use only your own piece"" version), making sure that you're not the player whose piece doesn't fit ertirely within the frame.Not that I'm recommending you should, but nonetheless gleefully noting that Pete Hornburg figured out how to get all the pieces to fit perfectly inside the game frame, thereby demonstrating the puzzle-likeness if it all, while more than hinting at the possibility of the perfect game and the observation that you're playing in a game frame.Lovely, the whole thing. Easy to learn. Short games (maybe 10 minutes). Fun for a remarkably wide range of players. There's the dexterity and luck part, so it's not necessarily the smartest who always wins. Which inevitably makes for more fun. Unless you get too serious about the game. On the other hand, it's good to know you can get serious about it if you have to - just in case.",toys games,games,board games

"I have a son(now 4 months) and I wished I returned it!Well lets take a step back, I was impressed with it when I purchased it... It had EXCELLENT saftey ratings, and had the 5 point harness. It was ADORABLE, and I just couldnt resist the Graco model. It was easy to snap into the base, or into our single or double stroller (have a 2 1/2 year old, and a 5 year old too)... It seemed comfortable (no baby in it yet) and it was lightweight. I loved how it was easy to adjust, and that it fit in both of our SUVs. I loved that the canopy rotated, and that the handle was comfortable to hold...Well, this is why I wish BRU would have taken the return (too late now, not worth it). Its TOO HEAVY when a baby is inside, and I felt like my arms would fall off, even though hes only in the 21st percentile. The handle is too hard to change positons, and it takes all of my might to do it! NOT ideal when theres s sleeping baby in it! The carseat SEEMED comfortable, but theres absolutely no padding for him to fall asleep on, he crys everytime! Well even though theres a lack of padding, he still swets bullets while being in it for only a few minutes, especially since here in NY its been SCORCHING, we wind up just keeping him in diapers or a t-shirt... The carseat doesnt fit in highchairs that restaurants provide, and it doesnt fit in shopping carts either... I HATE going into restaurants, they cant accomidate this carrier, I dont think we have eaten out for months! Grocery shopping is an equal pain in the ""tush"" because theres no possible way to do it now, and it would have been hard enough to do with the child in the front basket but with it in the large basket I cant get anything! The harness is hard to adjust, and buckle as well, it takes me about 3 minutes to get my son into the darned things while it should take seconds... Its also bulky, with a base in each car, its hard to squeeze in, but it shouldnt take that much room (my friend who had twins had about the same space in HER CAR than I do with my SUV).I really WANTED to love this seat, it rated GREAT in consumer reports, but due to its annoyance, and lack of ease, it gets a mere 3 stars from a mother of three.",baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

"I thought our cat would take to this NO PROBLEM. Boy, was I wrong! I first wanted to purchase CitiKitty before we even had a cat. We used to have a cat before we moved, and the reason we didn't get another right away is because we simply didn't like the cat litter. No matter how many times it was changed, and how many different brands we tried, our house always smelled! So, when I saw CitiKitty on Shark Tank, I instantly became so excited! No more stinky house!Almost a year later, we finally picked up our kitty. I sound like one of those crazy moms, but he's really smart! He picks things up quickly. We could put the kitty litter anywhere, and he always found it on his own--even when we took him on vacation with us for a couple of weeks. He wasn't afraid of the toilet at all--and even tried to drink from it over the water in his bowl. We thought we were finally ready to use CitiKitty, and purchased the system, along with the flushable litter. He was perfectly fine with it on the toliet with the the rings intact. In fact, as I was setting it up, he kept putting his nose there to see what was going on, and used it within 5 minutes. After a couple of weeks, and no problems at all with accidents, we took out the first ring. That's where the trouble began...he started doing all his business on the floor by the toilet. We gave it another couple weeks to see if he would snap out of it. Well, there was improvement--he started peeing with the CitiKitty, but still pooping on the floor. With both my husband and I working full-time, it was quite a mess to clean when we came home.We finally put the insert back in so it didn't have any holes. Again, he used that perfectly fine. No problems! As soon as we took it out again (when I had spring break and had a lot of time off), he started pooping on the floor. The system came with helpful hints, and those haven't seemed to work out too well. Since he preferred to go around the sides and back of the toilet, we tried to block that area off and even sprayed kitty-off there so he wouldn't be tempted to poop. Sure enough, ten minutes later, there was a fresh pile waiting in the ""no go"" zone. We haven't given up yet, though. We are going to continue to try!",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

I think they will come back to it periodically.,toys games,games,card games

Overall the product is decent, but the holes for the hinges on the door are crooked. This causes the door to not close smoothly. The drawer rails were already in place on the wood, and one of the screws was not put in entirely which caused the top drawer to not close. We had to take the screw out and put a different one in.

"I bought this product feeling confident that it would, if nothing else, smell nice and perhaps make the faded bits of my hair color a little more even. I bought it to *try* to cover or lessen my very white roots. I understand that this product is not meant to cover gray, but based on some of the reviews it seemed like it was worth a shot. I wasn't worried about the mess since I am used to dying my hair with permanent dye.When I first put this product on my hair I was struck by the unpleasant aroma. It is herbal, but in a very medicine-y way. It reminds me of some of those tinctures that chinese herbalists prescribe - they can be very pungent and unpleasant. It kind of grossed me out, but I applied the product liberally to my roots and worked it through the rest of my hair as best I could. (I have long, thick hair that is dyed dark brown.) I left the product on for about 30 minutes since many reviewers said to leave it on longer for darker coverage - it also says this on the bottle. The whole time the smell was nauseating me, but I tried to ignore it. I am shocked that so many people say that it has a pleasant smell.After I rinsed it out, the smell lingered in my hair. I was hoping it would not... shortly after rinsing it out, I actually vomited from the smell. I'm not kidding. Not only that, after it was dry, there was NO DIFFERENCE in my hair color. It did not affect my white roots at all and the rest of my hair looked exactly the same as it had before.Needless to say, I do not recommend this product at all. I am used to dying my hair so I can deal with strong smells, but this stuff was horrible and it did nothing. It doesn't even really condition your hair!!!",beauty,hair care,conditioners

The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product. The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful!

"Back in 1997, I thought I was doing a good job brushing my teeth with a manual brush once a day. However, I hadn't had a dental checkup for quite some time due to being a poor college student. So when I finally graduated and got a decent job with health benefits, I figured it was time to schedule an appointment. To my horror, the dentist said that my teeth were a mess, and that I needed to have immediate deep cleaning, with further work and checkups done every three months. She also recommended I buy a Sonicare toothbrush and some floss.I immediately complied and began using my Sonicare twice a day, along with flossing in the evening. When I went back three months later, she was amazed at how much my oral health had improved. My teeth looked better, I had a lot less plaque build-up, and my gums were pink and healthy. She revised her initial diagnosis and said I was OK to resume a normal checkup/cleaning schedule every six months. Whew.Of course, I've used a Sonicare ever since. I had to replace my first one due to charging failure, but I figure one blowout in nine years isn't so bad. The only usage issue I had was learning to let the brush do the work instead of pressing it down. I was counseled to merely hold it in place and let the bristles glide over my teeth and gums. That, along with toothpaste for sensitive teeth, helped ease the discomfort I was feeling after inadvertently brushing too hard. The two-minute auto shut-off is helpful, since it ensures a consistent and effective brushing period.If you haven't started using a Sonicare toothbrush yet (or something similar), then take the plunge. Make sure you replace the heads when they wear out in order to maintain maximum cleaning power (it's kind of easy to put that off). I wish they had been around when I was a kid, since I endured tons of painful dental work done that could've been prevented. The Sonicare helped save my adult teeth, and for that I give it my highest recommendation.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

It's just nothing special, the sauce actually started turning black in my fridge, and I've on had it for a couple weeks. The taste got worse too, I have no clue why. I'll close by saying if your looking for a good tasting hot sauce with some real heat look elsewhere.",grocery gourmet food,sauces dips,sauces

"The natural oils work very well on my curly hair. My hair is very textured and prone to drying and cracking but this conditioner keeps it moisturized without the need for a lot of other products. Since it also contains natural oils, it washes away nicely, too. I also find that after a few uses the oils help control frizzies and ""hay-head"" by keeping my hair in order.

"I have never disliked an Optimum Nutrition product I've tried, and this one is no exception. The 300g package gives you roughly 60 servings (each serving = 1 tsp.) of flavorless glutamine powder that mixes easily and well with every beverage I've tried so far. I usually just put it in my post-workout shakes, and you basically don't even notice it's in there. The only thing I don't like is the smell, because evidently flavorless does not mean scentless. I use ON's flavorless creatine powder as well, and that one smells very slightly of lemon-lime. This stuff, on the other hand, smells oddly reminiscent of Utz sour cream & onion potato chips. I know that's bizarre, and it definitely doesn't taste anything like that, but that's the first thing that comes to mind when I get a whiff of the open container. In any case, if you aren't taking any glutamine, or are considering taking glutamine, this is a great, easy, and economical way to get it.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks

"Normally I would ask, ""why bother to write a review about a gate?"" This one deserves the time it takes.I bought this gate for the foot of my stairs to keep my Westie puppy from going into the bedrooms. My original concern was the bar width. Not to worry - Gracie is 12 lbs of wiggle and the bar width would be good for a Yorkie.I now need to buy another for the mudroom - the cat box is just too interesting. It would be nice if they made a lower version of this so that small dogs were kept out but cats could jump it easily. As my cat gets older the height might be a concern, but for now he will be OK.If I have to live with pet gates, this one is nice looking and very well made. My husband was very surprised that it was so solid. I would not hesitate to recommend this product, and I'm picky.",baby products,safety,gates doorways
"I am lucky to be a stay-at-home mom, and only pump occasionally, but when I do these bags are great! After reading reviews on this and several other bags, each one seemed to have good and bad reviews, but I have nothing bad to say about these Lansinoh bags. My son is 5 months old now, and I pump 1-2 times a week at the most for a small outing/emergency supply. These bags are pretty easy to fill (just be careful pouring) and seal. I cinch the bag between two of my fingers right at the milk line, then ""zipper"" the bag all the way to the lock line with my fingers to get rid of any air bubbles. The double-zipper lock is also a definite plus. I lay them flat to freeze in my standard door freezer, then store them long-term in my deep freeze after they are solid. Fortunately I have never had any problems with leaking. I have recently increased the amount that I pump, so I'm planning on buying another box!

"We bought two of these seats for our kids after much research. They are very solidly built, durable, and I believe they are very safe when used properly. The problem is installation. Our cars don't have LATCH systems and it is next to impossible to install these securely with the shoulder belt. I typically have to wrestle with each one for 20-40 minutes, often injuring my back and fingers to get them securely into our '92 Accord. Using the tether helps but it's very difficult to get the the shoulder/lap belt tight enough to minimize play, even using the locking clips.They simply will not fit safely in our '93 Corolla. Even the LATCH installations can be quite difficult in the rental cars we've used. The straps can also be quite difficult to adjust--they seem to get stuck underneath. I would love to give these a much higher rating but installation is so difficult that it can seriously compromise safety, not to mention usability.",baby products,car seats accessories,car seats
"The Legendary Riders figures, coming between and during a run of pretty awesome build a figure sets as they did, didn't really spark my imagination personally. However, I did get the pretty cool Wolverine figure with motorcycle and finally after staring me down several times while I was in the store the Fantastic Four's Thing finally made it home with me.As a depiction of the Thing from the origin of the team it is pretty spot on. His rocky (Cap 'n Crunchy?) exterior looks good and the paint really makes it look like hard rock, which is good since that's all he's got as his uniform consists of his blue underwear. He does have a semi-constipated grimace on his face but its not really that bad. He has good articulation, elbows, knees, wrists, fingers, neck, ankles and so on.Now, the Wolverine has a cool motorcycle so is Thing's transportation just as cool? Ah, heh heh, nope. It's a Fantastiscooter or basically a hovering moped and to be honest he just looks silly sitting on it as he's so big and the scooter looks so effeminate. I'll keep it in case I get an Invisible Woman or Mr. Fantastic who might not look so silly on it.So good figure overall. Just forget about the scooter.",toys games,action toy figures,figures

"China Glaze is by far my favorite brand when it comes to nail polish and this color was no exception. Now I was a little skeptical when I first came across this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase. Some people mentioned a problem with the color itself, not being true to the bottle color. Well, I would have to agree with that. When I first got it and painted it on my bare nails I found myself to be disappointed but after playing around a little I found that if you put a single coat of white nail polish on BEFORE using this nail polish the color will be true to the bottle. You'll still need to use about three coats of this but trust me it's worth it. This nail polish is super fast drying which is great if you're in a hurry but I will mention that it has a matte like finish, if you're not into that don't let that stop you from buying this! Just add a top coat and you'll be good to go. :)",beauty,makeup,nails

"After a few years of using Frontline successfully, we decided to give K-9 Advantix a try because it claimed to be effective against mosquitos as well.After application, our poor min pin was absolutely tormented! He scratched almost constantly--he'd take a couple of steps, stop and scratch, take a couple of steps, stop and scratch...on and on. When he walked, his hind end protruded sideways as if he had some sort of major defect. He couldn't even manage to walk straight across the room.The sad part is, it wasn't until the third application that we made the connection between the Advantix and these horrible symptoms! (I know, how could we have not figured it out?) When we finally discovered that we'd been paying big bucks to torture our own dog, I was furious! 10 seconds with a search engine pulled up the very information that BAYER should have warned us about!Mind you, I had no prior knowledge of these side effects, so this isn't a conspiracy theory situation.

I didn't want to spend so much for something that I knew I'd have to take for the rest of my life but now I'm happy to pay for it, I've seen so many benefits. After two months I noticed that my body was purging all kinds of gunk, I was shocked at what was coming out of me, basically a lot more than I was putting in. I had read that that could happen but it was strange to actually experience it. This went on for about 6 months but it wasn't a horrible experience at all and I felt sooooo much better afterwards. My food allergies went away completely and so did my constipation. I also have absolutely no problems when I travel. My hair, skin and nails look amazing too.

"This is one hundred twenty-three dollars worth of placebo. Anyone considering using this or any other homeopathic remedy really needs to become aware of the fanciful principles behind homeopathy - it's not some sort of natural, herb-based treatment; it's pure wish-thinking. Homeopaths believe that a substance which produces disease symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure a person already suffering from the same symptoms. If that's not childish enough, homeopaths also believe that in order for this magic to work, the ""active ingredient"" must be diluted repeatedly until not a single molecule of the substance remains in the dilution medium (water.)Read that again - there are NO ingredients in homeopathic remedies apart from water, sometimes sugar, and whatever binding agent is used to turn this ""concentrated nothing"" into pill form. This is why homeopathic doctors (read:QUACKS) can state truthfully that there are no side effects to homeopathic medicines - there are no effects whatsoever, beyond a possible placebo effect. For years skeptics like James Randi have downed whole bottles of homeopathic sleeping pills while delivering lectures on the idiocy of homeopathy, with nary an ill effect, and without getting at all drowsy. Unfortunately, due to the general ignorance about this baloney, drug companies have even put homeopathic labels on actual medicines (Zicam, for one) just as a marketing gimmick, even though (by homeopathic standards) the medicines contain a huge overdose. Quackwatch.com has a good section devoted to this nonsense - I recommend anyone considering throwing their money away on these products (AND, by rejecting real medicine, jeopardizing their health) check the site.",health personal care,health care,unknown

"With Amazon now selling this directly for &lt; $20 this is the absolute best value in the entire Sonicare line. You get the same drive, the same brush head compatibility, 2 min timer and the ability to use your own rechargeable batteries. 5 years ago I purchased a Sonicare Elite 7300; the internal NiCad battery eventually died and the unit is not designed to swap out the battery. I tried, but ended up damaging the rubber molding and had a lot of difficulty finding a comparable battery that didn't require paying a high shipping cost. I eventually purchased the E3000 on a whim at a retail store for nearly twice what it sells for on Amazon nowadays and started using the newer low self discharge NiMH batteries. I get about a month of usage before I have to charge the batteries. And when the batteries finally start losing their capacity -- they haven't yet in 2 years -- I don't have to worry about performing major surgery on my toothbrush.I'm not sure I understand the water seepage/contacts/failure issues. I own 2 E3000s now, one for travel and one for home, and have used them both for 2+ years now. Neither have failed. I take care not to rinse the base of the unit under running water and I don't leave it sitting in a pool of water or anything. I definitely see the potential for failure as nothing but a plastic cap and a rubber gasket protect the AA batteries from potential moisture, but I think standard, common sense can prevail here. Let me stress -- I do not baby this thing. I use it daily in a bathroom that gets very humid during showers and summer weather (no exhaust fan and no central air conditioning). I clean it every usage under running water and I don't dry it off afterwards. I also have done the same types of things with 2 different E3000 units and have used them for over 2 years now and they have worked perfectly from day one.Highly recommended. I would actually feel comfortable recommending this over a higher-end Sonicare that was discounted to be within a similar price range as this unit.

We did as the instructions say and Annabell cried tears the very next time she cried. My daughter sings to her and she stops crying. She also rubs the doll's belly and she stops crying. Loud noises do wake up the doll. We were driving around town and an ambulance passed us and the doll cried. This doll is well worth the money. I love to watch my daughter be so loving to this doll.

"Reading these reviews is hilarious -- everyone's comments, for the most part, reflect ours. We received the bouncer as a gift so aren't so concerned about getting value for our money. But we agree with/have noticed the following:1. It does get too loud. We've put masking tape over most of the speaker holes. Function before fashion.2. Our frog clicks too. I sort of bent it outward (away from the frame) and the problem has been resolved now for several weeks.3. The vibration of the battery box is BAD. I will try the idea of taping it up somehow to the underside of the seat. We have arranged a temporary fix by putting a firm sofa cushion under the front edge of the chair to support the box and muffle the vibration.4. The toys are WAY too low. Our daughter is just now three months old and she's been hitting her legs on them for weeks. We will be cutting the parrot off this weekend as it's the worst offender.5. You should supervise your child in this chair. It has a tendency to be somewhat overstimulating with the vibration and the music and the waterfall and the constant movement. Wish there was a way to have the waterfall without the music -- again, masking tape would solve that problem.All that being said, the chair is fun, bright, and a good place to park the child after a feeding or while tending to chores.

"I'm not sure why this table is rated for children over 2 years; my 18 month old loves it! She has used it dry (without sand or water) as a Matchbox car race track! Then we took it outside and filled it with just sand. She loved it that way too! She spent 45 minutes shoveling and building sand castles. My 18 month old has never sat still for that long!!! When it gets warmer outside, we'll put her swim suit on and try it with water. I'm sure it'll be a ""splash""! I'm also interested in trying the table with dry macaroni/ dry rice instead of sand, as suggested in other reviews.The only problem I have with this toy is it comes with two boats, two small sand buckets but only ONE sand shovel. If you have more than one child, you'll need to be prepared with another shovel.The table is long, so there is plenty of room for several kids!!! I also like that the barrier between the sand side, and the water side is high and thick, so the sand and water won't easily become mixed while playing, although we both know it's going to happen anyway, right? :)I put this toy together in about 30 minutes (a power drill is a must!).

"First off I want to explain that I have had terrible acne off and on (mostly on though) for the past 8 years. I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school and then again my freshman year of college for another 3 months. I have been struggling ever since then and needed an alternative to dermatoligist bills and prescriptions for acne treatment.I was having extremely painful and frequent breakouts in the later half of last year and in early November I happened to stumble upon this product. I had my doubts because I had already given Proactiv a couple of tries in the past.The first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry! At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine. However, within 4 days ALL of my blemishes (big and small) had cleared up! Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned. Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot!Also, I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart so it's very convenient...no waiting for it to be delivered. I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack.Thank you University Medical for making an affordable product that actually works! Best of luck to all of you who are struggling with acne...and don't mark this one off your list!",beauty,skin care,face

Others have noted that it makes their skin look younger and wrinkle free.My mom is a chef and often gets burns on her face from hot oil splashing. She uses real aloe vera plants from the garden and applies it directly to her face. This has done wonders for her, leaving her scar free.

I followed the advice of a few people on here and mashed it up when I got it. It was difficult to get out of the container, but that wasn't a big issue to me. I did something wrong, and overflowed my toilet, but not too bad. The end result is what I'm concerned with, and it's brilliant.

"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality. It is not drinkable plain. Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible. In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.What should you drink? Anything you like. I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"". It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff. By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea

"I thought these toys were fun and cute at first. I bought 2 for my 5 year old in anticipation of a plane trip, since it was quiet and required virtually no interaction from her to use it. My husband checked them out after my daughter had had them a few days and was shocked to see that when the characters visited each others cubes, one would sometimes molest the other and then retreat when rebuffed. I could not believe it myself, but the ""random"" act was repeated about once every 5 minutes or so and was unmistakably crude. I called customer service, and after speaking to a supervisor, I was told they had not had any other complaints and that they had no plans at all to recall the toys. BTW this is a Mattel subsidiary and I spoke with Mattel customer service and supervisor, Peggy Patrel (spelling?) with Mattel Consumer Relations in East Aurora NY. There are other complains on Amazon and Toys R Us.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown

"This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that's all it's good for. Anything finer than coarse facial hair jams up the vacuum system, so forget about buzz cuts or body grooming. When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session. The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer. Although I've enjoyed Norelco products in the past, this one has been a disappointment and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"I'm officially an Omega Paw advocate! After all the dust, stench, and ugly box I finally decided to find a good litter box. I was thinking of getting an automatic self cleaner, but didn't know I would have came across this. When I buy something I do extensive research on the product. This product has positive reviews from Petco, Amazon, and Costco.Reasons this product is ingenious:1. Keeps litter in the box(I put a mat to help as well. I noticed a dramatic difference)2. Doesn't require replaceable filters (which other brands can add up in $)3. Doesn't force you to buy their company's litter. It allows you to use generic clumping litter. (also other brands can add up in $)4. Very easy to use and put together (It takes me less then 5 minutes to clean and less then 10 minutes to put together)5. Doesn't require power and nor does it have cords6. enough room for my big cat Toby &lt;37. Affordable/ Economical8. My dog isn't as interested in the new box,like he was in the basic litter box I had prior9. Reduces smell dramatically10. Comes with a lid so you don't have to see cat wasteDown Side:- Sometimes a clump might get stuck, but I kept my scooper and will just shovel it and then turn it over and everything gets filtered.- Not a wide variety of box colors (but the one I have is neutral and matches my house)Side notes:-I have 1 cat-Homes with multiple cats may have problems.-I clean it once a day (It's fun and I'm so thankful I bought it)But even when I had waited a week to clean it, it still worked wellOther Litter Box Notes:- My sister bought a Litter Maid and said she had to return it numerous times for repair (she only has 1 small kitten).when I demonstrated mine she was ecstatic and now is ordering one- My other sister has a Genie litter box for her 1 cat and it works amazing. Its like the cat has his own toilet and you forget about the chore. But the down sides is that it is very expensive to purchase, makes noise when it cleans out, requires you to buy their brands litter (but gets recycled a few times), and requires a place to plug in the pump (laundry area or bathroom)Hope This Helps :)",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking
"I purchaced this swing a couple of months after my son was born. He has the Nature's Touch swing in his room and he loves that but I needed something that could easily be moved to different rooms in my house. He sits very comfortably in the seat and loves to watch all the colorful lights as well as the hanging toys and swimming fishes. The music is sweet and soothing and often puts him to sleep. I like how there are different settings for volume, speed and your choice of music, no music or baby activating the music by pulling the toys. This swing is also great for travel, we have taken it to functions, other homes, as well as my in-laws camp and it keeps him very happy. It folds up easily and fits nicely in our van as well as in the car, it hardly takes up any space.

"My son is 15 months old now and he had this car seat ever since he was one year old. I remember the first time he ride in the seat, he was bouncing like a monkey. The ride was about 45 minutes and he was so excited. All in all, this car seat is a good investment even though it is quite expensive for a little baby. Yet, with the comfortness and safety, I think it is well worth it. The additional side protection, my son use it as headrest on the side when he felt asleep. It did not bother him at all. The head adjustment and straps are very easy to use. No sweat!!! The car seat itself is a bit bulky and heavy, but I put it on the side next to the window to make an additional seat space in the back. I can see him thru my back mirror. With this grey stripe color is perfect for boy and girl. I just love this product. I hope the expecting parent out there, do not hestitate to add this one on your registry.

"* Due to Amazon limitation, I'm posting the remainder of this review from my other account..[Continued]TONE IS KING-----------------I just wanted two things from offleash time(for safety) and that's:1) Come to my directly and sit at my feet and...2) Come closer to me...you're wondering too far and get on back near me buddy..lolI know the booklet clearly lays out how to obtain ALL the basic obedience commands and many of you may want that as well. For me, I'll put him on leash if I want to heel, but we can all get what is desired in the end.After working with him for not very long, he very quickly learned that the stimulation is a correction and he still does have to listen to me even at a distance and when not on leash. Different breeds surely will not all respond at the same rate...nor each dog in each breed, so patience is always important.He very quickly learned that the TONE is a precursor to a stimulation and quickly became totally TONE trained....Amazing! Now, it is primarily a remote tone device and all correction are done via the sound of the beep...and his tail is totally not between his legs when he has to come back... actually, he's happy and running and can't wait to be petted(which he gets when he comes back to me). I almost wish there was a physical button to disengage the stimulation buttons to make sure I don't press them on accident(which has never happened) since I so rarely ever have to nick him. Point being...after not much time, it's an awesome remote tone device which he quickly and happily responds to. This has really changed my view of eCollars...when used properly.We went on a 3 hour walk yesterday(yea...we were both wiped out after) to the beach and park and boat harbor...ALL offleash once we hit the park and he was in total heaven. So freeing for him to be able to follow his nose...have fun..go around..and still be attentive to me. He would also normally bolt after other dogs because he loves them and wants to meet them...and now will instantly come back if I Tone him and say 'Come'. No cowering...he's fine and like...ok well...I'll sniff this here then. Lol.SHORT SUMMARY-------------- Great tool when used responsibly- Kind of strong...I'd suggest not going with the 'Stubborn' model unless really needed...and you don't mind orange..lol.- As the booklet clearly states... the dog should be TOTALLY basic obedience trained(Sit/Stay/Come/Down/Heel) by you and on leash before either of you are ready to use this tool.",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids

After about three weeks the new blood test showed that this product did the trick. So, after digging around on Amazon for some liver supplement products, I grilled my vet, and eventually dragged the actual name of the product out of them (thumb screws are a great invention, btw!).

It keeps breakouts at bay, speeds up the exfoliation process, cleanse pores and does away with dry skin.One caveat, every once in a great while I'll run across an ""off"" smelling bottle, but it happens rarely and the product is so nice, I ignore the random inconsistency...",beauty,skin care,face

Babies do not wear short shirts and underwear. They wear diapers. They do not wear lipstick or nailpolish, either. And they don't have this much hair until they're older, most of the time.Yasmin has gigantic, slanty eyes that look evil. She also has huge lips with pink lipstick. Her hair is ugly, it is not even real. It is plastic and you can pull it out of her head. They say this is supposed to be a new hairstyle, but it makes her look like a strange boy with lipstick and holes in the top of his head.She also has a strange looking pet frog and a bottle on a chain. A chain! Real babies do not wear their bottles on chains! I don't really believe the people that say it is so she can carry it, because BABIES DO NOT WEAR THEIR BOTTLES ON CHAINS!!!If you buy this for a young child she will probably want to dress like a Bratz doll and wear way too much makeup.

"I guess to each their own. I have come to the conclusion after reading thousands of reviews on products that some people are never satisfied and will find the smallest thing to gripe about. I REALLY like this seat. My best friend had one and bought one for me after her son got sick from eating in a restaurant highchair. I already had an older seat that was a pain to use because it was in a million pieces and took forever to put together. This seat is 1 piece, 2 if you count the tray. It is compact, portable, light, and takes up hardly any space in my trunk and has a place to put your fingers to carry. The tray snaps on the underside and the straps wind-up into the seat. Have my straps twisted inside...yes, but they fixed themselves and did not pose a threat to my child. Does the tray fit tight..yes, but atleast the food doesn't fall down in his lap. My child doesn't have a big stomach, so the tray isn't too tight on him. Sometimes, I leave the tray off and let him eat off of the table or a plate. The clips on my tray have not broken, but my friends did and they sent her a new tray. The flap/compartment is very shallow but can hold a bib or two. Mine has never popped open like some have complained about. The legs are not hard to put in place, and they add a nice height to the chair. Now, a complaint by a reviewer that has bothered me is..the seat doesn't remove to clean....HELLO....If you go to fold the seat, you can fit a napkin, sponge whatever down there and wipe all of the crumps out (if there are any) and wipe down the seat. If your straps are dirty, take a soapy sponge to those too. I take this seat everywhere with me and would be soooo lost without it. We had a playgroup the other day with 7 moms and 8 kids and I kid you not...ALL 7 OF US CARRIED IN THE EXACT SAME SEAT....THIS ONE!!!!

I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store. The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices.

"I bought this watch for myself and really wanted to love it. My old talking watch died on me and I needed a quick, economical replacement for it. This one seemed to meet those criteria. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. After less than 2 months, it just plain quit working right.There ARE good points about this watch. There are 4 diferent alarms to set for time reminders. I loved that. It woke me up, alerted me to it being time to get the kids off to school, told me when they would be home soon and let me know when it was time to start getting them ready for bed. I loved the stopwatch feature. I was really in love with the date function. In so many ways, it was everything I wanted. And then there were flaws...I loathed the watch band. Looking at the picture, it appeared to be your typical rubbery plastic sport-type band. But it wasn't. It's a stiff plastic that really made it a pain in the backside to buckle on my wrist. And then there's the fact that it's lasted me a mere 6 weeks before dying on me. I turned off the hourly report feature one nite. 45 minutes later, when I went to check the time, it didn't respond. It was totally blank. Ticked off, I set it aside and looked at it the next morning. It was once again showing time (the incorrect time), but the buttons wouldn't do anything. No talking. No resetting the time. Nothing. I've never gotten it wet. It's been taken care of. And it just died.Now, perhaps I got a bad one. One of the parts in it just fizzled out. But when you're visually impaired and your watch dies, you're kinda up the creek without a paddle, so to speak. If I were you, I would buy a totally different watch. If you want something cheap? Independent Living Aids sells a REALLY cheap talking watch for around $7. It's ugly to look at, but will do the job if you need that.

"We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it. Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not. It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable. We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe) We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason. (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE. It's a very low pee guard. Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there. (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be) And it does not come off. I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring. It's one of the worst designs I can imagine. It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder. So I decided to skip this. Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item.

"Hubby bought this on his Amazon account for me. We have cats and we need to keep the dog out of the cat room.I'll start by saying the construction of the gate is great. It's a solid well made piece. The main door is easy to work and I don't have a problem with the width - however I do not have to go through this door multiple times daily either.The pet door is where I have to give this gate it's low rating. This small door is whole point of the gate and I feel it needs work. I have a 50lb chubby dog and he fits through this pet door with no problem. The entire purpose of this gate with pet door is to let small animals through while keeping larger ones from passing and it does not. I can't imagine many animals that couldn't manage to squeeze through if my dog nearly walks through the 10x7 opening.Though it is not sold as a ""child gate"" I imagine many people use it for that purpose. Be ware that your child likely will be able to get through this opening until they are big enough to just work the latch and open the door.I had my husband cut out one of the bars in the small door making it much smaller. This made the pet door size more inconvenient for my cats as they now have to really slow down and aim for the opening in the gate it also is very tight for my large cat. However it's the only way to keep my dog out",pet supplies,dogs,doors

She went thru a short period of no interest, but that seems to have passed...She's old enough now to have it in the more upright position with the tray attached for play, and she still naps there, too.

I loved this stroller the first couple of time that I used it. It folds up really easily and compact. You can carry it on your shoulder like a backpack when folded up. It is super lightweightand very durable. The storage basket underneath could be bigger but it works. My daughter finds it to be very comfortable as well. The only thing that I don't like about it is that my daughter figured out that the back part that she leans her back against is not attached to the stroller. It is hard to explain you would have to see it for yourself. You can lay the seat down so they can take a nap. It is operated by a drawstring so it is attached but if she leans forward all of the way and then scoots her body forward she can touch her feet to the floor even when in the 5 point harness. If the stroller is not on lock she will pedal herself away which I feel is a saftey hazard. She thinks that it is fun when I am trying to shop and she keeps trying to pedal herself down the isle.

"The active ingredient in this product are copulins which are odoriferous fatty acids secreted by the woman's vagina when she is in the optimum stage of fertilization and arousal. These copulins attract men and have been scientifically proven to cause a temporary testosterone spike of 150%.Since this product was made for women, one may wonder why a man would want to use it. In theory, copulins let women know on a subconscious level that the man with copulins on him has recently been with a woman and gave her great pleasure. So the man is tried and true and worth competing for. If you are a married man, you shouldn't use this product without telling your wife first. Otherwise, she may suspect that you've been with another woman.PCC comes in a small 5ml roll on bottle and has a weak watermelon/cucumber fragrance.As a male, I haven't had the responses and reactions I expected from women using this alone. Most of the responsses I got from women were not very noticeable or very subtle. It seems to draw womens attention but they seem rather neutral or indifferent to it. A few women however looked like they were undressing me with their eyes, but not consistently.I've noticed reactions in myself when wearing it in that it makes me more assertive, confident and even impatient. I also tended to fantasize a lot more about women when wearing it. My reaction on other men has varied. Some men acted rather silly around me and others more competitive and agressive to down right rude.This is a very good product when used in the right context. I've had very powerful positive reactions from women when I've used this product in conjunction with androstenol (another pheromone product). Some of the competitive effects come out such as women stepping in front of other women to talk to me and they also tend to be more giggly.From my experiences, using PCC alone will not consistently attract women when used by men. Given its effect on me when wearing it and on other men, there is no doubt that it attracts men when worn by women. I wouldn't suggest that any woman go out wearing PCC alone unless she wants men to come on to her strongly. A better use would be for a woman to put the ""spark"" back in her marriage.",beauty,fragrance,women s

Does my 2 yr old boy realize that it doesn't work? No, but it sure would be more fun for him if it did. Durability - terribly annoying given that 6 different things keep breaking off every 1-3 minutes & my 2 yr old can't fix them himself but is bugged by the sudden change in his toy. So what happens?

"I bought this item after my son was diagnosed with a problem that won't allow him to sleep on his back. We are living in a remote part of the world with no 911 service so this Angel Care is literally our Angel. (this and knowing infant CPR!) We sleep so much better knowing that if our son stops moving during his sleep, we won't sleep through it. It has woken us up twice, thankfully because he had scooched off of the pad. It was a huge comfort to know the Angel is so sensitive. The alarm does not wake my son enough to keep him awake all night either; he goes right back to sleep, if he wakes at all. We absolutely recommend this product to any worried moms and dads who reluctantly have to put their little one on their tummy to sleep.

"My daughter received this bed as an early (22 mts) birthday gift. It was time to say good bye to the crib. My daughter gets in and out of the bed without any problems.I was afraid she would roll around (like in her crib) and fall out of the bed, but the sides are about 5 to 6 inches above the crib, so she'd really have to roll out of the bed. I like that it converts to a twin bed (extra pieces are included, another board, four rail extentions and a oval piece, I don't know what that does, I guess I'll find out soon enough).The night light has a timer so if your daughter likes to play with buttons don't worry about burning out the light...however I do recommend buying the A/C adapter then using batteries. I like the storage places, but don't recommend putting a lamp on top like in the picture... However, I do have my daughter's Hello Kitty CD/Radio player on one of the towers.If you have a car and don't know anyone without a truck, spend the money for shipping.

I use it with Precious Cat litter and the clumping works great. All you have to do is add litter as is necessary when it runs low.

In two and a half weeks, we have used two very expensive and hard to find 6 volt batteries (had to order from Amazon, actually, ) and now the collar is just spraying occasionally and Lucy has caught on to its defective useage. I would not reccommend it at all, even if just for the fact that the batteries are so expensive and short lived and the spray has to be bought continuously and only from THIS company. Also, when I tried to return, the company said they do not deal through Amazon and must be returned directly to them. I thought Amazon stood behind its products and sellers????

He would eat them and then repeat the operation. I then put my finger into the feeder spout and was able to shake the feeding device and get out cat food pellets.Needless to say this was not what I was lead to believe in the product advertising.

As a result, all you can buy for this are their disposable boxes which are VERY expensive and LEAK. Who wants to have cat pee on their floors, that's the whole reason we have litter boxes, to keep it off our floors.

"I got fed up with buying expensive 3/4/5 blade razor blades that didn't do the job. Not only would I very occasionally find 1 type that worked and then see it taken off the market; but they caused razor rash and if I ran my hand over my legs when I got chilled after bathing, heck, it felt like I might not as well have bothered. Big time stubble! Not only that, but I was shaving my forelegs twice a day eventually to try to get the smoothness that one expects from shaving, otherwise why bother? That got me all nostalgic for the 70's when I'd use Dad's schick razor and blades and my legs would feel silky smooth and razor bump free. (Sorry Dads, you know this happens with teenage girls!) I finally decided to do something about it. I read all the reviews I could about the safety razors, finally selecting this one. I love it! But - Warning! Do NOT use this razor when you're already running 20 minutes late for whatever it is! Take your time. Enjoy the process and remember the goal. I also purchased a selection of blades like the guys have recommended and a 5 pack of Feathers. My biggest error was to try the Feathers blades first, thinking sharpest has to be bestest. DUH! Not a good idea at all! I figured it would be like riding a bike, right? Once learned, not forgotten? Wrong. I had developed very bad habits such as applying a lot of pressure to today's razors in my rage to get at least a semblance of smoothness. Gentlemen reading this to this point are probably paling already - no learning curve, Feathers blades AND pressure. Very very bad move. Let me say that again.....Very very bad move. So much so, I was about to give up, figuring I'm a big idiot, but not a huge amount of money out of pocket. Then then I tried the Derby blades (among others, and I can tell you that the advice to buy a selection pack, or multi 5-packs of the most recommended brands is a must) Ahhhhhhh! What joy! The skin on my forelegs is too thin for Feathers, - at least until i master the technique, - but the Derby blades and this razor are perfect for me. No more shaving twice daily YEEEAAA! Gentleman, if you think shaving your face twice daily is a PITA, you can imagine what it is for the ladies to go through. My technique is soaking in a good warm bath, followed by a mild scrub of the legs with a loofah and soap. Then I use a shaving soap (still experimenting on the best one for that), combined with a little oil. The oil is very handy for me as it does really help to reduce razor bumps eventually to zero, particularly for the top of the legs/bikini lines. The razor is frankly marvelous. My legs are once again smooth and silky. Unscrew the razor and wipe both it and the blade dry after use. I can use the blade 3 times, which given that we're talking 2 legs at a time here, is not only great, but a lot cheaper. Just an afterthought to wind it up, - make sure you have the first bit of the base that connects to the pole the right way round :-) (that is, with the 2 sided ""comb"" facing outwards, or you're not going to be very impressed. Conclusion - Ladies, make the change and get off of the high-priced, third-rate useless take it or leave it stuff that's out there.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"This is the best travel system out there! As for the grocery cart situation, you aren't supposed to be putting ANY carriers in the top of carts due to it being unsafe! (whether it clicks in or not) This stroller is lightweight, has adjustable handles and great storage room under the stroller. The carrier base has levels built in so that you can properly install it into your car! It also has a compartment in the middle that can store things that you may need quickly, and also keep the owners manual safe.This stroller is SO easy to fold up, with just one hand and foot! I can hold my son in the other hand while I do it-if needed! That was a big selling point on my part-besides the adjustable handles.I love how you can put the leg rest all the way up, and recline the back all the way down to make this stroller like a carriage so that my baby can go on a ""stroll"" around the neighborhood comfy in just the stroller part, instead of having to be in the carrier. And he can easily fall asleep and I feel safe leaving him in it to finish his nap in the house, when we get back.You definitely MUST at least check this travel system out before deciding on one for yourself.

This seat is less then half the price of the last booster seat I had (the Fisher Price Space Saver) but I like it much better!I understand the two seats have different intentions. The space saver is meant to be more like a high chair and is meant to accomodate young babies, but as a booster this seat beats that one out of the water. I love that there is no cover to clean around or have to wash out. It's all plastic so it just wipes down. The adjustable base is easy to adjust and allows me to put my daugther at just the right height.The tray is nice and secure and she has not been able to pop it off, which is a great as that's an issue I've had with seats in the past!There are 2 things that kept me from giving it 5 stars, 1) I would love to see a 5 pt. harness option. My 8 month old is a busy body and she as able to turn and pull herself up unless I have the waist part very tight, which means adjusting it depending on what she's wearing and what kind of diaper I have her in (cloth or disposable). Might not be an issue for some, but it is for us. 2) the snap in tray doesn't snap in tightly. She easily removes it each time I put her in the seat. Not a big deal right now as she is not self feeding yet, but I'll probably not use it once I let her, as it could end up being very messy for my floor.Otherwise, I have no reservations about this seat.

"As with others, received 2 Side A's instead of mirror image side B. However, laughably, the English as second language instructions call for 2 side A's, which seems to be a cover up on the company's part to avoid having to go through their boxes and actually put the right parts in. The chair can actually be assembled this way, but looks terrible and ill conceived. Wooden plugs don't stay in holes; anyway the half that you can actually plug when assembling the chair as per the directions, which by the way have sloppy and difficult to decipher hand drawn diagrams that look like they were done by a 5 year old. Belt is cheap plastic and wouldn't hold any size or sort of creature with any degree of safety and security. My 9 month old immediately squirmed out of the belt and stood up despite my best efforts at adjustment. Finish is passable but uneven, and unprofessional tooling is evident everywhere. Chair wobbled once assembled, so I turned it over to see if I could locate the cause; this turned out to be a completely missing rubber foot; only three were present. Worse, the three rubber feet that were there were screwed in, and the place where the fourth foot should be did not even have a screw hole to indicate a foot had ever been installed. Apparently counting to 4 is too difficult a feat for the crack squad of furniture technicians at Lipper, who were either drunk, lazy, or lacking in the basic art of giving a damn when they built and packaged this utter waste of your hard earned money.Bought this looking for value; instead, every aspect of this product disappoints severely.

"The fact that you get three puzzles and a book in this one package is what really makes this set a good deal. The puzzles are sturdy, with cheerful scenes of Thomas and Friends. The manufacturer was clever enough to put different patterns on the backs of the three puzzles as well, so you can separate them into three piles before trying to build them (and thereafter keep them in separate baggies, if you want). Or, you can mix them all together from the start for an additional challenge as your child grows up.The 5-7 age range is probably pretty accurate. My son is 4, and these puzzles are still a little beyond him, but he loves to ""help"" me put them together by finding pieces for me, talking me through them and placing an occasional piece.The book really rounds out the deal. At first my son didn't seem to show too much interest in it (he has tons of other Thomas books), and didn't care for me to read it to him for several days after we got it.

"This stroller is certainly light and looks exactly as pictured. It does not feel that sturdy but seemed okay. Most notably, I too was very surprised by how narrow it looked once I recieved it. Now, only a few months later my daughter looks very uncomfortable sitting in it...and forget reclining her in it! I now have to buy another stroller so unless you only want something to use while your child is quite small; trust me and go with another stroller. Oh, and by the way since I know some will assume children that do not fit are large - my daughter is somewhat tall and quite slender. Go ahead, look at the dimensions (I wish I had) this stroller is 17.5 inches wide and most others are 19.5",baby products,strollers,lightweight
"The new My Scene Jammin in Jamaica series is the best out of the whole collection so far since the very first series came out last Christmas in 2002 with just Barbie,Madison,& Chelsea. I was so suprise when they first came out i was like ''oh my Barbie go a new way younger look ,WOW ;)'' And the clothes they wore were more fashionable and came with detail accersories like shades,funky shoes ,handbags and more.Since then and now they came out with more friends like Nolee and Chelseas cousin Delancey and even boys too like ,River,Ellis,Sutton,Huson and Bryant, soon theres 2 more friends Tyson and Jai too.I have like all of the whole My Scene collection now its kinda weird but hey I love them and they give me lots of new ideas for my fashion Designs lol.Its also fun have to have them around for decor in a room for funner way younger look . I just got the some of the Jammin in Jamaica dolls now ,but I also have viewed the DVD movie that came with and its actually fun and cute to watch, cause it kinda shows how fun young peeps are like now,like how they hang out and they bound and more.The way they did the movie cartoon cartoon typea nd colorful like you see on TV, not like the movie clips seen on the MYSCENE.COM website ,But the movie is about a rock band called ''URBAN DESIRE'' that Barbie and her friends knows its there boyfriends actually its Ellis,Sutton,River & Hudson. There competed in a contest called ''beat 2 beat contest'' with other bands and the band that wins goes to Jamaica and compete again with some other finalist bands and gets a major record deal if anyone of the bands win .And Barbie and her friends also meet new friends like Delancey, Tyson that Chelsea has crush on ,and Jai too that Sutton has the hots on.But for now i dont want to say no more about the movie i'll just let yall see for your self cause theres so much more in it and i dont want to say.

"I have used Yves Saint Laurent Touch&eacute; Luminous Radiance for five years, and I would not be without. I don't have dark circles under my eyes, but this provides coverage and luminosity for that area. I use it on both sides of my nose, my chin and upper lip. It is the most remarkable product. I have tried many products to cover imperfections, but this really is the best. It is light, not heavy, glides on, under and over make-up, which ever you prefer.I used to purchase this product on a TV Selling show, but they stopped carrying it. Amazon is the best reference point for any product that you might need, and if you become a prime member you have free second day shipping.One important point in using this product is that you need to pump the chamber 30 times at least for the product to appear .

"I ordered this for the first time last year around the holidays. I wanted to make Nigella Lawson's guinness gingerbread recipe but had no idea what muscavado sugar was. I was thrilled with this product and will order it again this year before the holidays begin. It was fabulous in the gingebread and in homemade wheat bread. I used the last bit of it in some sticky toffee pudding for Christmas Eve dessert, heaven! It is great in oatmeal and I did try it in cookies but didn't care for it as it made the cookies crispy vs. soft and chewy, the way I like them, but if you're a fan of crispy cookies, the flavor is great. Also, didn't care for it in my coffee as several other reviewers recommend. I read the 1 star reviews and they were given because the sugar hardened, my sugar was soft and fresh but does harden quickly once opened if not stored in an air tight container. I have one of those terra cotta clay pieces that help keep your brown sugar soft and it works quite well.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies

I realize that cologne/eau de toilette is highly subjective, but I always found Grey Flannel to be more manly, more subtle, less sweet and less heavy than other men's fragrances.

Then I did some research and found out that much of their protein is from gelatin or collagen which is 100% worthless to humans for building/maintaining muscle because the amino acid is not good. Also lots of palm kernel oil in these which isn't too good for you. There are much better options out there. If you want something with better protein (but still has some palm kernel oil) and tastes great, try Metabolic Drive protein bars. If you are ok with eating something that is just ok tasting, then Zero Impact are by far the best bars out there. Great protein, healthy fats, low sugar, no sugar alcohols.

"I've used Lactaid for years, and as the years pass, the product keeps getting better and better. I used to have to take more of it for it to work, now I use one tablet just before eating the serving of dairy, and one tablet in the middle of eating the serving of dairy. It works great! One thing to be careful about though, is if you are as slow eater, you'll have to take more of it. When I eat a bagel with cream cheese for example, which takes more chewing than does ice cream which takes none, I end up using three tablets instead of two to be symptom free (e.g., one at the beginning, then I eat 1/3 bagel/cream cheese, take another, eat another 1/3, then take last pill for last 1/3 of bagel). Another great tip which I discovered.....when I began taking calcium supplements along with the Lactaid, it made my own symptoms disappear completely, so you might give that a try. My doctor says its probably because calcium supplements slow movement of the digestive tract. All in all, Lactaid Fast Act is a great product for lactose intolerant individuals and I highly recommend it.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"I used a boppy with the first two, and now I'm using My Brest Friend with my 6 week old son. It's much better than the boppy. The boppy never seemed to be in the right place for support. I would end up using several pillows around the boppy to support myself. The back support of My Brest Friend and the adjustable strap make it totally comfortable. As a mom of two preschoolers as well as a newborn, I sometimes have to get up and walk around while he's nursing, and it's great that the pillow stays in place instead of dropping to the floor. It also makes for more comfortable nursing in the hospital (when you have to nurse on a hospital bed) and in the car (when you don't have any other pillows around you).My only complaints are that the silent release buckle isn't always silent, unless you press it just right -- I guess I haven't learned the trick of it yet. Also, the cover is not as easy to wash and put back on as the boppy.

I had blown out two of the less-expensive WaterPik models (differing by only by the color of their water holder--one was clear and one was opaque cream color) in a period of only 3 months so I was very wary of anything carrying the the WaterPik name. But then I saw the ""Ultra"". ""That's got to be better,"" I thought, ""or they wouldn't have used the word 'Ultra' to describe it. To me, the word 'Ultra' means something that goes beyond others in whatever property you're considering.

"This is a great two-player game. It has the right mix of skill and luck to keep an even playing field. And it's fun.The description spends a little too much time trying to convince you there's a story, but it's just a good card game. Each color represents an expedition. For each expedition you begin (play cards for), you subtract the cost so you need to collect enough of that color to make a profit. The really tricky part is that you have to play the cards in numerical order. If you play the red 8 and then pick up the red 6, you won't be able to play the 6. Since you have a limited number of turns, you are sort of playing chicken to hold on to the high cards long enough to get the low ones played first, but not so long that you run out of time to play the higher ones, too.",toys games,games,card games

arthritic joints and generalized pain reduced using this versus plain hydrulonic acid supplements. Of course (while not really knowing as haven't stopped taking after 3 months yet) this probably is symptomatic; but anything that reduces inflammation tends to let the body try to heal itself. I have been taking the max doze of 2 twice daily with notably reduced pain. However I also take a number of other supplements so it's impossible to isolate which provides more benefit. It would be good to hear from users who limit their intake to a single product for several weeks and report the with or without results. Nothing is actually capable of eliminating the underlying arthritic or even osteoporosis; however it would be valuable to know what is more than symptomatic relief (although that may be all one can get with these underlying conditions).,health personal care,health care,first aid

They do give me peace of mind that my little ones can't get into the closets, which is definitely worth a little expense. They also blend in well and since we have only had them a few days, I keep forgetting they are there until I can't open a closet, which is a good thing. I'll definitely be shopping around if/when I decide to buy more, to see if I can get a better price.

"This game is unlike any other I've played! The object of the game is to be the first Reach DORK PARADISE! All players start in the Gene Pool where they must choose weather they want to be a Dork or a Keener. Players then make their way up the D.N.A. (Dorks need Action) strand and begin a journey that will have everyone involved, laughing! The questions are Crazy,(some with no real answers) and the stunts are very original! This game is not for the shy! Some cards last the entire game (cry like a baby every time a 5 is rolled.) and some just for a round (get underneath a piece of furniture and take an item with you. pretend you are playing an instrument for the entire round). Be careful not to go to Another Demension! While there you must repeat everything you say twice for two rounds.

I tried several times and ways to fix it, but it would not stay up.I contacted the company and they told me to ""stuff it with wet towels and spray it heavily with starch..."" are they kidding? Then I found a reference to this problem under their web site FAQ's. So, they are knowingly selling a defective item and expecting the customer to then fix it. They never responded to my second email... I could not return it because it had been used.This is a company that does NOT stand behind it's products.

"Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball / B0002DK26MI really like food dispensing toys, because I like for dinner time to be interactive and exercising for my puppy. He sleeps through the night and during much of the day while I'm at work, so anything that encourages him to move around and exercise is a plus.This is by far my favorite food dispensing toy. There's a single hole to pour kibble in, and there's no tricky balancing act required, like with so many of these toys. When I first placed the toy down, my puppy (aged 4 months, 12 pounds), had no idea what to do with it. I rolled it around every few days and he was happy to vacuum up the food dropped by the toy, but he just didn't catch on to pushing the ball himself... until I added a couple of small, smelly, freeze-dried liver bits into the ball and then he went crazy. He absolutely loves his food ball now that he's figured out that he can make it give treats, and I always pour a couple of tiny ""surprise"" treats into the ball to mix in with his usual kibble. Even though I bought the large size, he has no trouble padding after it and pushing it around with his paws. It makes dinner time much longer and more interesting, for both of us.I have had no problems with durability with this treat, although I'm blessed with a puppy that doesn't chew much (yet!). Still, the plastic seems very sturdy, in my opinion. I also do not notice a plastic smell, although maybe it dissipated over time - we've had it for several weeks now.It you use treats in the food ball, I recommend trimming their size - we use treats for training and we cut up all the treats we buy, usually to the size of a fingernail clipping. The dog enjoys the treat taste without filling up or getting sluggish and fat. They are also much easier to mix into the kibble that way.~ Ana Mardoll",pet supplies,dogs,toys

A few years ago, we added this to Feline Pine pellets (1-2 inches on the bottom of the pan) for a great combination. We put about 2-3 inches of Cedarific on top of the pine pellets. The pine pellets do most of the absorbing and the cedar adds fragrance and additional absorbency.

The basic rules are much the same as RISK, but with several twists that definitely give the game a LOTR flair. I particularly like how the One Ring moves along the board, following the same path Frodo and Sam take in the movie. Another nice feature, that separates this game from the original RISK game, is the fact that there are several ""strongholds"" that give an advantage to either the dark forces or the free peoples depending on the geographic location of the stronghold. Also there are ""leaders"" that can lend strategic advantages when attacking or defending in battle. Now about the seller",toys games,games,board games

It has a hungry hippo game that is pretty fun if you're not a three year old like my daughter, she does't quite understand how to move the hippo left or right.Calling out is just like a cell phone, first you have to dial a number then press the main talk button. It won't send unless you dial numbers first.The only thing that I don't like about it is when you dial out and there's another recorded voice on the other end of a little girl asking ""Hi, what are you doing today"" pauses then responds ""that's great have a nice day"" that part is great what isn't so nice is that the pause is for about two to three seconds. It's teaching my daughter to talk really fast before hanging up. It's like the cell phone commercials about loosing signal or saving minutes you have to talk faster and faster to save your minutes. It doens't allow your child to be creative and make up stories. Even my daughter has noticed and gets frustrated. I kind of what to take the batteries out and letter her make up the start and end conversations herself, but then there would be no lights or sounds.

We both had a great time, and it was fun to watch her little mind work as she tried to figure out the different coin amounts. There are cool aspects to this game, with the money bag space, and the bank exchange. It really encourages little minds to figure out the amounts, and it's a GREAT way to learn about money (other than a workbook page). The money is even pretty realistic and detailed...and there is a nice amount of it included. She kept commenting on how much she loved this game, and I think it will really help her be more confident in counting money and remembering which coin is valued for how much etc. Two thumbs up!!!",toys games,games,board games
"The Thomas train sets are great modern versions of the classic indestructible wooden train sets. Simple enough to avoid the toddler age frustrations of getting the cars to run on the track yet complex enough to engage a wide range of ages (up to and including Grandpas). All the stories help with the imagination part....the books & videos provide an endless source of adventures that can be acted out, although most kids are perfectly capable of inventing their own episodes.Here is my advice, if you are trying to work your way through the maze of start-up options:First of all, you can spend a fortune on a huge set....even if you can afford it, I would start with something small and give the child the joy of receiving a chain of small but intriguing presents over a long period of time. It fosters the joy of giving/receiving and helps teach them to come back again and again to the same toy...watching it grow, asking for specific items from the stories they hear, etc. Several reviewers suggest painting an old coffee table and this is a great idea.I suggest the Figure 8 set (the most popular one) or if you want to spend a little bit more, the Conductors Figure 8 set. Both are complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to give lots of room for growth. Almost immediately I would add a new present of one of the inexpensive engines (you can ask the child which story they like best and get that engine for them....or buy the engine to go with the video or book in the same gift)....these would be Percy The Small Engine, Bill The Yellow Engine, Treavor, (or a bit more $ for:) The Lady Engine, James The Red Engine, Gordon The Express Engine (he's one of the best stories, I think), or Henry The Green Engine.Now for the good stuff! Give it a month or so, and then reward the child with something really cool like the Barrel Loader or Rusty the Construction 3 Car Set.I honestly can't see the point in the huge multi hundred dollar system sets. If you want to impress the neighbors or something, go for it, but I'm telling you.....most kids will enjoy a large number of small thoughtful gifts, not a ""keep-up-with-the-Jones"" effort on your part.Good behavior can be rewarded with a pick-your-own trip to the store (there are sometimes when a real time shopping trip can't be beat)By the way, the Thomas stories are based on real restored engines that run in England on the Mid-Hants Railway Watercress line near Winchester (you can read about them an even plan a trip to ride on the real Thomas trains by checking out watercressline.co.uk). They are a day trip from the London rail stations, although I recommend using a B&B; in the Winchester area and staying overnight if you decide to go. Winchester was the center of the old Saxon kingdom of Wessex of King Alfred as well as a major early medieval site (the Cathedral has the tombs of many of the Saxon Kings as well as Jayne Austen and Izaac Walton and it was where Richard the Lionhearted was crowned.)",toys games,vehicles remote control,play trains railway sets

"Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems. Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing. My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated. For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result. I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep. I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle!I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help. I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable. I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Amazon Prime benefits.To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit. When I tried my first cup, I hated it. It tasted like musty, minty licorice. I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it. Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay. My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it! I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it!The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes. When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference. I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst. And the next morning? I woke up practically engorged!I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful.

"This car seat is great! It's comfy for my baby and is easy to lift in and out of the car. I really like the adjustable height base, which makes it easy to get the seat in place at the correct angle without all the rolled up towels underneath required with other models! I like the 5-point harness and it's great that it comes with an infant head support (removeable with snaps). The canopy is large and can be adjusted over the baby's head or at the baby's feet, to block direct sun. The car seat is narrower than some models, which allows for a little more room in our back seat. I bought the matching Colby Metrolite stroller too, and the two work together to create the PERFECT travel system! I really love both products. The half-star I deduct for the car seat is related to a pretty insignificant annoyance I had when I installed the canopy - one of the plastic arches used to shape the canopy bent when I put it together, which doesn't effect the strength of the canopy or the way it looks at all, yet, but I'm worried it's going to break since the bent spot is weakened. That said, I'll be calling Graco to send a replacement part, and I'm confident it will be easily taken care of at no charge to me. In my experience, Graco customer service is outstanding. Overall, this SnugRide can't be beat, and I especially recommend it with the matching stroller.

"TwinLab propolis extract tastes good without bitterness. It also contains other herbs to boast the immune system. I am a hepatitis B carrier for many years. Last summer (2007), my ALT was 171 IU/ml and my hepatitis virus count was 56,000,000 copies/ml. I started taking a variety of bee propolis extracts including TwinLab propolis extract since last December, 2007. My blood test results in April, 2008 were a big surprise to me and my physician. My ALT was 33 and my blood virus level was down to 19,000 copies/ml. My virus level was 9,700 copies/ml in my blood test in August, 2008. I feel better and look better also. I was prescribed to take Hepsera, which inhibits the proliferation of the hepatitis virus. However, there are side effects and drug resistance may develop. Furthermore, I was told I will have to take it for life. There are many pre-clinical studies of propolis extracts in small animals suggesting propolis extracts inhibit bacterial, viral and fungal replications. Furthermore, propolis extracts enhance the immune system to destroy these micro-organisms and also provide other benefits. So far, propolis extracts work for me.

"This product gives instant results. It gives hair shine, strength, and manageability by helping get rid of frizziness instantly. I have been using it for about 2 years on and off and the condition of my hair has improved a lot from dry and frizzy. I am able to blow dry it straight now without losing a lot of hair. Also, for those who color their hair you can mix this oil with the hair dye before you apply it and it helps protect the hair from harsh chemicals. Although, it is a little expensive, I am very much satisfied with this product and I also recommend anti-age PHYTOCYANE to use for those who have weak hair that tends to break when you comb your hair.

Instead of the older NHL series SP's that have a sticker with there name and the teams logo it has the name of the player painted on the base.If you are a fan of the Islanders I say this is a must buy if you have been a fan your whole life or just a few years like me.Hopefully TMP will make Al Arbour, and Clark Gillies in the future sometime.",toys games,action toy figures,figures

So, I bought it and I got the hang of it after a few days. It's a great tool since it allows you to tell it how much you are smoking and then it will tell you when to smoke and when not to smoke. It's relative to the Pavlovs Dog's Theory. Everytime you hear the chime go off in the program you are supposed to smoke. After about 34 days, the chime never goes off again and you don't think twice about smoking. It's a great tool since the chime isn't like any other chime out there.

He loves it and the heat is also a nice feature.The reason why I gave it 3 starts, it's because of the vibration given out by the massager, my hand gets a funny sensation, it's not too pleasant.

I get alot of compliments and some strange looks because it looks just like a baby stroller, even better than some of them I was told. ****The only thing I would say bad about it is that the mesh cover has a toxic smell to it....BUT once I took it outside a couple of times it did air out, and the smell is gone. ****Also to make it more comfortable I did place a cusion lining inside.

I've had puppies that were much harder on toys than this pug too. Part of the problem seems to be a quality control issue as no other toy we've had has had seams open like this.The 'log' part is great for putting other toys in though - and they enjoy chasing the empty 'log' around.

"Great day eye cream. This cream is pretty pricey but I have to say it lasts me for about 9 - 10 months. I initially got a sample size from Sephora and fell in love with it when I tried it. (That being said Amazon has the best price, Sephora price's are ridiculous) I love that it does not leave a greasy feel at all like many other eye creams and has an spf which is hard to find in eye creams. It also doesn't cause those little white dots that can form near your eye. I always got those using other brands of eye cream such as Clinique's all about eyes, which I now only use at night. Switching to only nighttime use keeps those pesky white bumbs away. My eye area is too dry not to use a night cream and I feel it's kind of a waste to use Murad's at night since it has the spf in it. Many people complain that Murad's eye cream burns terribly if it get's into your eyes which I have to say that it does but that is IF it get's into your eyes. But the benefit far out way's that con and plus it's no different than getting eye makeup in your eye and that doesn't deter me from wearing eye makeup either.

(If you have any questions or uncertainties about how to use this, ask a pharmacist, a doctor, a nurse or call the manufacturer to make sure that you're using the thermometer correctly.)The thermometer numbers are easy to read and after you take your temperature you can just push the on/off bluish button a second time in order to turn off the thermometer. If you forget to turn it off it will automatically turn itself off after ten minutes. Impressive!Overall, I highly recommend this type of thermometer.

Whether I wear them while out and about, exercising or put on before Igo to bed for the night (if I feel my legs are swollen); put them on & the compression keeps the swelling at bay. The only down is if I wear for more than a 24 hour period my skin will havea slight reaction to the silicone banding on the back of my thigh area. It goes away after a day.

"Back in my college days when I dabbled in playing the guitar, my teacher taught me finger picking. The most important thing about finger picking is to have strong, well shaped fingernails (since they serve as your 'picks'. And it was my guitar teacher who pointed me towards crystal nail files.The price put me off at first, but under his assurance that I would love them, I went ahead and took the plunge. And he was right -- all other files pale by comparison. Even though my guitar is now abandoned in my closet, I still use these files.The grain on the files goes from coarse to fine, so that you don't have to move from one file to another, and they give a wonderful, smooth finish for an instant manicure. Having such a gentle, high quality file for my nails seems to have made them stronger. The cleanup is a snap -- you just wipe them off and wash them occasionally, and they're quite durable. I did eventually break mine, but it was only by accidentally stepping on it. I've even sat on it plenty of times and had it hold up.So give them a try.

I was also told that these vitamins use the purest ingredients (e.g. no soy), for even for the ""containers""--the ""skin"" of the oil softgels and the capsules for the loose powders.

"Bought this for my 7 1/2 month old son as a splurge, hoping to find a toy he would actually be interested in for more than 5 minutes. Great interactive toy. He is more interested in the train for the moment than the animals. He can spend over 1/2 an hour playing with the wheels, the moving leaves, and bananas that are attached to the train before wanting to move on. There is also a little red bird attached to the train with a spring that bounces back and forth as he bats it. Very few toys keep his attention for this long (which I guess is normal for his age). The only things that he will play with for longer periods of time are small cardboard boxes and small plastic tupperware lids, all of which I can find around my house for free! Still, I consider it a good purchase, because it will grow with him, and he can play with it differently as he develops.One note though... one ear on the elephant broke after a day. It is still attached to the elephant, but it no longer makes the clicking noises it is suppose to as it rotates.",toys games,baby toddler toys,push pull toys

I have been using these particular microfiber hair turbans for years now and couldn't be happier. I have tried many others but have never found any this good. Others get wet to the touch on the outside because they don't absorb as much moisture. Plus this one is easier to get on and stay on with the button attachment. The button never comes off after years of use and washing and the turban continues to be absorbant. These make great gifts for the ladies.

"I purchased this product, about 2 weeks ago, in the hopes that this type of pest repeller had improved since the last one I attempted 5 years ago. This item has a thoughtful design, including a pass-thru plug (2 prong) and nightlight, and the innovative addition of an air ionizer that made placing this in a bathroom or closet a multi-purpose solution.When I first plugged the unit into my downstairs bathroom outlet, my 2 cats 30 feet away in the living room started to growl and ran upstairs. My child came downstairs shortly afterward complaining about the painful warbling sound coming from downstairs. Apparently the ultrasonic frequency is outside of adult hearing, but adoloscent ears have a hammer and anvil response range beyond that of adults (until they're done growing, and the body loses flexibility, such as when the bones start to harden). I further tested the unit in the garage and an upstairs closet, but found the results were the same for both cats and family.I am unsure of how pests respond to this unit, but it definitely repelled my cats and child, forcing me to discontinued use of the product.",health personal care,health care,first aid

"My extended family and I take a vacation every year. During this vacation we usually play games until late into the night. This year we played Ticket to Ride - American version for the first time. I am not really sure how many other games we actually played this year because this game was always out on the table. I am fairly new to ""non-hasbro"" games and because of this game I will be trying more.The object of the game is to complete the destination cards you are given at the beginning of the game. Each route between cities consists of a different number of train cars that may have a specific color or may be gray. During your turn you can claim a route, draw the train cards, or draw more destination cards. The train cards are what allows you to claim a track. If there are 4 red cars between two cities you need to have 4 red train cards to claim it. Once a route is claimed no one else may use it.I bought Ticket to Ride - Europe because it added a few new game play features. These features make route completion a little harder but train stations are added to even out the difficulty. The hardest thing that we have found in the game is getting used to the city names that were used. The game takes place at the turn of the century so some of the cities that have been renamed since 1900 are still using their old names.Both of these Ticket to Ride games are a blast. The American version is ""easier"" than the European version but don't let that sway you. You can always play without the new features if you get the European version and once you play a few times the new features will become second nature. Enjoy!",toys games,games,board games

He is learning more fine motor skills trying to stack the pieces, especially when the flowers are spinning!

"Prior to purchasing this I've never bothered with a scratching post, because frankly I find most of them quite unattractive to leave out, especially in the family room. Given that my 3 cats had grown up never seeing a scratching post in their lives and making do with the corner of my couch I was worried it would be hard for them to make the transition.However, I finally decided to buy a new couch to replace the one they had shredded and couldn't bear the thought of an expensive new couch being destroyed like the old one, so I gave in and bought this post.First, I have to say that, while it isn't modern art or anything, it isn't the eyesore that other cheaply made scratching posts tend to be. It is good quality lacquered wood that looks more like furniture than a cat toy. I'm pleased with how sturdy it is and that it was reasonably easy to put together without tools. It also comes with great instructions for training your cat to use it in the form of a sticker on the bottom. Some people have complained about the sticker being hard to remove, but on mine it was on the bottom of the base which is against the floor where it doesn't show so I just left it there so I could reference it again if I ever needed it.So the most important thing. Did the cats take to it?I put it across the room from the couch they normally sleep on all day and out of convenience use as a de-facto scratching post. It was close enough that it wasn't much effort for those lazy beasts to lumber across the room and use it, but not so close that they would continue to associate the couch with a place to scratch. I also rubbed some catnip in the pile (as suggested by the sticker), set them next to it with their paws against it. They got stoned pretty quick off the catnip and completely ignored the post in favor of wrestling with each other and rolling around on the floor. For the first day they didn't avoid the post, but they also didn't seem too interested in it either. I started thinking that my fears were confirmed and I had just blown a bunch of money on an expensive post. HOWEVER, within a few days they started curiously going over there and expressing a little interest. After a week and ever since they have been using it constantly. Success! Now, if one of them goes over and starts scratching, they all have to go over and join in. We have had a couple of incidents when they scratched the couch again (luckily the old one, haven't gotten the new one yet), but mostly when I'm sitting on it and they are trying to get my attention and not so much for the purpose of sharpening their claws. They definitely prefer the post to the couch for that.I almost think that somehow that catnip was a deterrent and they didn't really use it until the smell of it faded from the post, which is weird because they usually love that stuff. All the better for me though, since I don't have to keep re-treating it.I'd definitely recommend this to other cat owners. It worked for me.",pet supplies,cats,beds furniture

"This lovely, high quality Sandalwood soap by Caswell-Massey is made of natural, vegetable based products. The soap is triple-milled which means that the soap is very hard and will last a long time. The lather is mild and creamy, leaving the skin lightly scented with this special sandalwood blend.This is the larger size which is referred to as the bath soap. It is darker and has a wood grain appearance. The bath bars are larger and weigh 5.8 oz. They also carry a smaller size hand soap. It is light tan and comes in the 3.25 oz (92 g) size. I have used the hand soap as bath soap and cannot tell the difference--the scent and soap quality is the same.Caswell-Massey's line of sandalwood products have been a favorite of mine for many years. The scent is so wonderful I use bars of this soap in my clothing drawers to infuse my clothing. While this blend may use other ingredients to create the blend the primary scent is the characteristic sweet woodsy fragrance of sandalwood.Sandalwood is the name for a variety of trees (19) in the genus Santalum. True Sandalwood comes from Hawaii, Australia and India. The essential oil is very expensive and the quality varies according to the age of the tree and the species. It is naturally antibacterial which can assist in keeping skin clear of blemishes. The sweet woodsy aroma is calming and is used in ayurvedic medicine to treat anxiety.Caswell-Massey is America's oldest apothecary established in 1752.

Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way.

"I have two cats, the little one is just over a year old and the princess, who is about 3-4 years of age. Well the little one decided that she needs to knock over anything with water, glasses, bowls, you name it. We tried the ""untippable"" bowls, but she still managed to put all her weight on it to make the water bowl flip. Every night I would come home from work and there would be water all over the floor and the cats meowing... So finally my wife and I decided let's get a pet fountain and see if that does the trick. Once it arrived the cats knew who the fountain was for, it's amazing how they have that sense when something is for them (then again they have that sense when things are not for them too!) They stood and stared at the water fountain for a good hour or two after it was all set up. The little one took to it quick and started drinking from it. The princess would not stand for change and refused to drink (even obligating to drink from the toilet). I was confused as to why she would do such a thing because ever since she was little she drank out of the bathtub after everytime someone showered... Anyways, I made sure the fountain was the only source of water available to them in hopes the princess would change, and eventually she did, and doesn't mind drinking from the fountain at all. Although, she acts like she is doing something bad everytime she is drinking and is always tense. The little one just sits there and drinks water all day. I have had this fountain for 6 months, and I have to say, no more tipped over bowls and my cats are probably drinking better water than before. There are some negative aspects, if you don't fill it, the motor starts making some weird noise. Also make sure to clean it if it makes any noise too. Overall 5 stars, great product! would recommend to any of my friends.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies
"I have 2 kids and together they have about 8 various vehicles that take the flexpack ""flash charge"" battery. My kids LOVE their Speed Wrenches and their Jack Knife(s). The Motocross Bikes are awesome too. Anyway, I was told by the company about 1.5 years ago that they were going to sell the batteries seperately. Well, to my knowledge, they never have. I would love to be able to buy the battery separately. I cannot afford to but the charger every time I purchase a battery. I am very disappointed about this ""handcuffing"" of me the consumer. They have the monopoly on the flexpack and are using it to force you to buy the charger since the bateries are not sold separately. I was told that they would be about 9.99 alone. I would buy about 8 more for extras. What ever happened to customer service? Please start selling the batteries seperately.",toys games,hobbies,radio control

"Really love this collar!Definitely does what is designed.... only problem I have is that sometimes if one of my dogs is barking it will set off the collar on the other, and that dog gets a spray in the face for no reason! Usually they are rough housing pretty aggressively, so it's not necessarily a bad thing. Aggressive play = spray in face = time to calm down a little.It would also be nice if there was some indication when I turn the collar on that the battery is working (like a tiny light).Definitely would recommend, after using it for just a couple of hours one evening, the dogs did not bark upon seeing me the following day.6 Month UpdateUnfortunately, as my pup has gotten bigger, she has began to bark more (learned from other dogs I believe). However, if I put the collar on her, she stops (or barks just once and then stops). It would be nice to know when the collar was out of fluid or needed a new battery. In the last 6 months I have replaced the battery one time, and have bought one new can of citronella - although we probably only put the collar on her once a week for the day. The device is a little big - espeically since she already has a collar on, for this reason I feel bad leaving it on her for extended periods of time - but she doesn't seem to mind as she will gladly let me put it on her.Even with some room for improvement, I still recommend this product for medium to large dogs. It's quite large for a small dog to wear!",pet supplies,dogs,collars

"The swiveling lid binds with time, as it picks up fine dust from the vitamins within. The dispensing hole is way too small to allow the pills to fall out. First thing you must do is enlarge the hole - double or triple size. You can't make it too large. The cap needs a flange to make it more easily removeable. You must grab and pry the lid off now when it's time to refill a column. It works, and I haven't found one better, so you're stuck with this one. Given a choice to buy it or not, I'd buy it again until a better design comes out. One good thing about this one is each section holds many pills - in contrast to most others.

"Cascade manufactures a great product with their water-soluble pouches of dishwasher detergent. These pouches take all the mess and guess work out of adding the dishwater detergent to your dishwasher before you start it up. Just place one pouch, unopened, into the main dispenser cup (not any other cup) of your dishwasher, close the dispenser cup if you have to--and then just turn on the dishwasher! The pouch with its soap and Dawn gives you very clean dishes that actually DO shine just as Amazon notes that they do. Great!The pouches cause no harm to septic tanks; and your dishwasher runs just fine with them instead of the regular dishwasher detergent you may have used up until now.After the dishwasher cycle is over, simply remove the pouch from the dispenser cup and discard it. Make sure that every time you take a pouch out of the plastic bag they come in that you reseal that plastic bag to help maintain the freshness of the remaining dishwasher detergent pouches.This form of dishwasher soap mixed with Dawn and a mild cinnamon apple spice scent gives you such shiny, clean dishes that it becomes addictive! This product does the job of cleaning your dishes marvelously; and once you try them you'll be hooked just as I am now. SMILE In addition, one reviewer notes that these packages will save you the effort of carrying very heavy containers of detergent from your grocery store. They come out to cost about 22 cents per dishwasher cycle; and I guess that's about the right price for a sophisticated product like this one with all its excellent packaging.The only caveat is that this does have a cinnamon apple spice scent to it. If you are allergic to any scents or perfumes try an unscented form of dishwasher detergent.Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a dishwasher and cares to try to just make things easier for themselves when it comes to loading up the dishwasher or preparing it for a wash cycle. These bags make for no muss/no fuss deal; and that's quite all right in my book!Use them in good health!",health personal care,household supplies,dishwashing

However, upon arrival of the package (which was in good shape without visible damage) the Citrus C's were hard as a rock. I don't know if this is the way they are supposed to be and there was nothing on the packaging of product review that led me to believe this was not the way they are supposed to be. I've tried feeding 4 or 5 of these to my guinea pigs, individually, at various points in time, different times of day, paired with different foods, etc. To no avail!! They won't touch them - and honestly, there is no give to these things so I don't think they would even provide much benefit to the piggies for their teeth and need to grind.

"I purchased this seat for my son who just turned 2. He is very big for his age (35 pounds), however, he is not mature enough for a booster seat. I liked that this was safety rated for up to 65 pounds, as I know my son will need to be buckled in for a long time yet. Anyhow, the seat is way heavy, which I liked. It looked and felt very safe. I installed it into my very small car and it fit okay. I raised the head-rest as high as it would go (since at the highest setting a child should be able to use until the top of their ears are at the top of the head-rest) and at that setting the head rest was about 2 inches from my roof. Not a huge problem since I am planning on buying a roomier car this fall. The seat was very easy to install and adjust. The crotch strap was too short and too close and my son was pretty much sitting on top of it. I had a friend of mine try it with her son who is a year older than mine (my son cannot talk and has a high tolerance for pain) and he said that it hurts his wee wee to sit in it. I sold it on ebay and bought the Marathon instead. I really liked the side impact protection. That was the reason I had purchased this instead of the Marathon to begin with. The seat sits up high, so my son really liked that. He did not have a problem with the wings blocking his view. Anyhow, I believe this seat would be great for an infant, however, it is not very comfortable for toddlers.",baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

"Having gone through many filters to sustain a 25 and 55 gallon tank, this has been the best filter I have tried as far as aesthetics and noise. Most filters I have tried produce a terrible vibration or rattle despite ad hoc washers used between the tank and filter to diffuse some of the vibration. In addition, from a fish's perspective, the vibration can be disturbing, unsettling, constantly evoking as stressful state and condition. This filter is silent mechanically with no vibration or rattling. However, the water flow is louder which I do not mind; it creates a tranquil trickling water-sound that can be heard and monitored around the house. If you are looking for a completely silent filter and are lazy about tank maintenance, this may not be the filter for you unless you enjoy the falling sound of water. However, if you are looking for a silent filter and are meticulous about tank maintenance, this filter would be ideal. It is low profile, the bio-wheel is a great, practical feature, and by maintaining a high water level, this filter will be soundless and sufficient. Another feature I did not realize until use, was there are two filter slots in each unit. Having purchased two 20-30 gallon filters to use on each side of the tank, this allows for 4 total filters to be used at once plus the additional bio-wheel on each filter.The size of unit is smaller than I anticipated as well. Considering I am pushing 300 Gph with two of these in a 55 gallon tank, I will opt to further purchase two of the 50 gallon filters with a push of 200 Gph for a total push of 400 Gph while requiring no additional room; the sizes are relatively similar. This will be optimal for my tank set-up, waste filtration, and fish health. Anything to be a little lazier in tank maintenance; environment disruption should be created only when absolutely necessary. An ideal tank will be self-sustaining requiring minimal owner conditioning and maintenance once acclimated and properly configured.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters

"I was always thankful that I had been able to keep my wisdom teeth. But despite best efforts, my dentist at my last cleaning visit told me I was getting unacceptably deep pockets back where it's hard to clean, and it was now time to have them out. The hygienist told me about this device, which I promptly ordered. Two months later, on a visit for a new crown, I asked my dentist to see if he noticed any improvement in my wisdom teeth. He was so amazed at the improvement, he asked for info so he could order one too! He said the pockets, previously 7 to 9 mm were now only 3mm, and my gums were totally healthy again. I just use it once a day, and also follow the recommendation to rinse afterward with a peroxide rinse, and then a salt-water rinse. I personally hate flossing, and am always looking for an alternative. This is far more effective than flossing!",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"I bought these walkie talkies for my 6 year old for Christmas- he loves anything that's Spy Gear. He really likes the secret codes and my 3 year old really took interest in them too! They don't work too well indoors - I guess that's because of the walls. But we haven't tried them outdoors yet. I would assume they would work better without cbstacles. But for the price, they were a real good buy, and I didn't expect them to work over long distances since they were under $15. Both of my boys really like the belt clips too - makes them feel like official spies since they get to carry them around.

"Finally, a gigantic 18"" Spider-Man that can do (almost) any pose a real human can do! Clearly it has enough points of articulation. Even comes with a spring-loaded web launcher! The back and sides of the box boast the assorted poses it can do. It truly can be posed into nearly anything. But it also has some drawbacks, read on to find out.My first impression of the figure (other than undoing a gazillion twist-ties to get it out of the box) has got to be the WEIGHT! It's pretty HEAVY, folks. If you're buying this for a little one, take into the fact of it's gargantuan size and weight. It can be a good thing, but sometimes it's weight is what makes it difficult to stand.Second was the articulation itself. ToyBiz has a nasty little habit of making articulation points, but yet not making it very tight to HOLD the pose. If you own ToyBiz's stuff, you know what I mean. ToyBiz DID fix this problem on this figure...kind of. It's joints are kind of like gears! Instead of bending to pose, this figure has ""gear"" type roto-appendages in the pelvis, knee both joints, both arm elbow, foot, and chest joints. (Lego hinge pieces, or Power Ranger Megazord arms, are a moderate example of what I mean). Every single one of finger parts, as well as the toes, wrist, shoulder and thigh parts are like ordinary bend joints, and the head/neck and waist have swivel joints. ...But again, the weight of the figure sometimes is too much for some of the joints, and collapses on itself. (particularly the chest, in my case)Finally, getting him to STAND was a challenge all in its own! It took me nearly 2 minutes to get him to stand in the same leg position with just a few arm or head changes. The roto-type joints are tight indeed...in fact, TOO tight. I had to use BOTH hands to get the elbow joint to work for the first time. Getting for him to take the pose you want -AND stand him- requires A LOT patience. Standing him wouldn't upset a little kid too much, but having difficulty posing Spidey just because the gear is too tight might.Overall...I guess I'm pleased with it. But I'm now forced to question the safety of the toy. This IS NOT a standard action figure. It's HEAVY, and could cause alot of damage if thrown or dropped. Even though it says 6 & up, it takes me, a grown man, a lot of effort to pose it the way I want it, not to mention some moderate strength to lift the thing. Don't think dropping it would break it, it's a pretty sturdy, solid plastic build (except for the chest, which would crack under extreme pressure). I suggest buying one of the 12"" Movie II figures that shoot water or flip; much less frustrating for younger kids. But hey, I DO think this figure'd make a perfect statue, wall mount, or conversation piece once posed and set in an eye-catching area.-Doctor Cain",toys games,action toy figures,figures
"I got this set for my 3 yr. old daughter because she loves Spongbob and just started playing with Barbie dolls. I thought the dolls were really cute upon getting them. I was disappointed that they don't seem meant to come out of their costumes. Although with much struggling, I was able to get the one out of the Spongebob costume. My daughter likes playing with them, but often tells me ""Look Spongebob and Patrick are eating little girls!"". While that's funny, it is kind of creepy too and I can see how she thinks that. Overall a cute toy, but wish the dolls came out of the costumes.",toys games,dolls accessories,dolls

I contemplated triple paned windows, I even tried putting foam against the windows.One day I thought, what about a sound machine, so I checked here and read the reviews. Noises that sound like birds or the ocean weren't for me. I read about this one and bought it.My life has changed for the better! At first I thought, huh, it's kinda loud, but for some reason the constant noise is very soothing. I sleep longer and sounder now.

"I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.What to do??I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes ""okay"" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency.

"I actually bought this wheelchair and brought it over with me to Hong Kong for my 90-year-old mother. It is extremely light and well made. It is the second lightest transporter wheelchair out there. It's so easy to collapse and open. I particularly liked that fact that it is 17"" wide rather than the standard 19"". My mother is very thin so this was fine. I just thought it's hard enough to get through doorways as it is, the narrower (if the person can fit in it) the better. DO take that into consideration! The only other transporter that is lighter than this one is made from Medline, called the featherlite transporter (or something like that) at under 15lbs...but it is 19"" wide. This wheelchair is 19 lbs and it still felt really light to me. I'm only 5'3"" tall, and I had no trouble pushing my mom around.I bought this chair along with a cushion. DO get a cushion because transporter chairs don't have much support for the tushie. The other thing to be aware of are the foot rest. They do flop around once you fold up the chair. I recommend getting a small zippered nylon tote bag that is small enough to hold the foot rest and store in the back chair's pocket when not in use. The foot rests are very easy to remove. But they can fall out when not in use. So get a small carrying bag for them.The nylon fabric is sturdy and well-made.

However, we threw that cage in the back of our truck bed. My husband tossed it in pretty hard and pieces started flying around. I was sure it would break, but it didn't break. The pieces that came apart were easy to bold back together when we got home and it was no worse for the wear.",pet supplies,birds,cages accessories

"I can't understand why these Orka chew toys are marketed as being able to ""stand up to tough chewing."" My ""power chewer,"" who is a MINIATURE daschund, about 8lbs, not even 8 months old yet, just ate the ends off of the ""Orka Stick"" within 30 minutes of getting it!The photo on the toy's packaging shows an adult golden retriever chewing on it, so I assumed it would be perfect, if not a bit too big, for my small boy. I just spent $8 on a toy I can't trust him to chew on. He will swallow that rubbery stuff or choke on a piece if unsupervised. I already had to dig a few pieces out of his mouth!I actually bought him one of the mini Orka bones when he was teething, and chewed right through that one, too. I thought I'd give the bigger, seemingly more durable Orka stick a try, but now I'm wishing I hadn't.Anyone have any suggestions on a chew toy that really IS durable?",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"To start, I'm the type of person who carries dental floss in my pocket for after meals, so when I heard of the WaterPik I was definitely interested. I received my unit as a Christmas present and the scene could have been mistaken for a little kid getting an amazing toy - Amazon box ripped open, packaging carefully but quickly removed, and a quick wash to prepare for use.Very easy setup, fill the tank, pick your 'pik', plug it in, and turn it on (hold the 'pause' button if you don't want your bathroom sprayed). I have a slightly receded gum-line, but the instructions to follow the gum-line and pause between each tooth worked. I started with the standard pick at about half-power and it succeeded in removing the rest of my breakfast.I now alternate the standard and pik pocket tips (for a problematic area in rear of mouth) and use a watered down mouth rinse solution in the tank (If doing this, be sure to wash/flush the system as outlined in the manual). Occasionally I will use the tongue scraper tip which definitely cleans it but gives a tickle to the tongue.Definitely enjoy this product and recommend it to anybody looking to get a totally clean mouth - I use it in conjunction with a Sonicare toothbrush and between the two my mouth has never felt better!",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"I know this toy has gotten some bad reviews but my son absolutely loves it. If your child loves music and Elmo, they will probably love this toy!

I hear this toy numerous times a day! Sometimes my son will knock him over on purpose to hear him say ""Elmo fell down, a little help please"". I agree that there isn't much educational value that comes with this toy but not all toys have to be educational. Kids learn through all types of play. Actually, music in itself is educational.

"I have not seen any babies playing with this toy so I can't review it in that capacity but what I can say is that the person I bought this for thought this was a very cute toy for her baby. The only drawback is that the birds have eyes that can come off. Babies really like the crinkly squishy shapes, and it would have been better if the birds didn't have eyes that can come off and become choking hazards. It says its for babies 8 months and above probably because of the eyes. Of course any babies younger wouldn't know how to use the shape sorter but they would probably enjoy feeling the birds and squishing them and chewing on them. Without the eyes I think this toy would be for a broader age range.",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters

"We were excited to assemble this playset only to quickly realize that it's a very poorly constructed toy. From the get-go, removable pieces couldn't even stay in place and pieces were either falling off or tipping over. Definitely a frustrating thing for a young child. For the price that was paid, it should have been more durable. The only impressive thing about it is the detail they put into how the castle looks. Unfortunatly, I consider only one (out of two) main pieces of the castle to be functional (and somewhat entertaining) with its trap doors and levers. The second part is useless and is already stuffed in a bag with all its pieces fallen off--and we just bought it an hour ago!

"I've used this shaver for about 3 months now (have used electric shavers for 20+ years - Remington and Braun), so here are my thoughts. If used daily, it cuts pretty well and gives a nice close shave. If I skip a day, it doesn't cut all the whiskers, and I have to use the trimmer. If I skip 2 days, forget it. It probably cuts about half of the whiskers without using the trimmer.This shaver is noisier than the 2 Braun shavers I had before. Enough so that it bothers me when the shaver is under my sideburns. And as others have noted, the shaver tends to kick out the whisker cuttings and leaves a mess on the countertop.The good news is that the battery life is pretty good. I'm getting 2+ weeks on a charge. You can go much longer than when the battery light first comes on, without any loss in performance.All in all, I'll go back to Braun when this shaver dies.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"In its category of front backpack style carriers, its the best, But when deciding what ""kind"" of carrier is best, well, it may fall short. I go this because I tried my friend's and I loved it. I felt like there wasn't much pressure on my back, and I could be hands free without worrying. The bad thing about the whole style of carriers is that the baby is close, but detached at the same time. They must feel like they are in some kind of contraption, just hanging there. I have a sling (adjusting ring) form maya wrap, and its good, but there is just too many pressure points on me, and I find myself adusting it all the time. I have not tried backpacks but they look odd, heavy, and too expensive anyway. So any mom out there looking for a good carrier, I suggest the european made (german I believe) DiDimos. Its a huge peice of fabric, that you use to wrap around and tie the baby to you. The baby can feel close, comfortable, be in alot of different positions, and grow into it (bjorn is good for about 7 months). Many moms that have tried slings may find them uncomfy, but this is totally different. there is not rings or adjusting things, beacuse there is no need for them, and it wraps around you forming an x at your back to relieve pressure. The baby feels totally secure (no hands) unlike other slings that may feel like they are slipping. It also looks great and is a nice blanky when you need one. Its pricy (search for deals) but you can just make your own with the right fabric. Didimos boasts that it is of a special weave. good luck, butdon't substitute a stroller, you will definately need one :)",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers

"I heard so many great things about this product in reviews from Amazon to just about every parenting magazine out there. It's a great developmental toy (useful for two-handed play and hand/eye coordination) it fits tiny hands, it rattles, it's a good teether, it provides distraction, and it's easy to clean. So of course it was high on my list of toys to buy for her last holiday season.However, while I believe it helped my daughter with some of her developmental milestones, I feel other less pricey toys helped her more. Likewise this toy had its moments where I was glad to have it for teething but my daughter seemed to find the small tubes frustrating and less satisfying than a thicker teether. The Winkel was a helpful distraction but only for a very limited period of time; once she started throwing it, she never stopped and refused to play with it again.I'd probably buy it again because it ticked so many boxes in the few months (about age 3-6mo) that my daughter had any interest in this toy, but that may also be because I still really want to like it more than I do and I like saying the word ""Winkel.""",baby products,health baby care,teethers

"Neutrogena Rainbath Awakening, Shower and Bath Gel is an absolutely wonderful product! The scent is a sweet, floral scent that's strong enough to last for hours on my skin -- but isn't overpowering. It works up into a nice rich lather and makes my skin feel nice and soft. It's also nice and moisturizing. However, it's very thick and, at times, hard to pump. But that would be my only complaint about it. I felt very refreshed and smelled wonderful each time I used this. It wasn't something I used everyday, just when I wanted to feel special. I'll definitely share this with my friends!",beauty,bath body,cleansers
"I am usually not a big fan of sheer, pale colors, but I found that I really like this one. When going for a neutral, I find I usually end up with some taupe color on my nails. I decided on this one and was pleasantly surprised. It is definitely not a pink-y pink. When you hold it up to other pinks (like Pinking of You or I Pink I Love You), it looks almost like a light taupe or nude color, but holding it up to a taupe, it looks pink. If that makes sense. I had no problems with application and it dried rather quicker than I anticipated. After two coats, the color looks nice and on nails it looks like a pink but not Barbie pink. More like a lace pink. As with all OPI's, a base coat, two coats, and top coat did the trick til I was ready to take it off and try another color. Also - this will make pale hands look darker.",beauty,makeup,nails

"I used the Litter Maid self cleaning box for a year until the motor burned out. Even before then, I had to clean out the rake once a day and pry up clumps that had stuck to the bottom of the litter box. When the motor died I took a chance on the Omega Paw, or as I call it, the Roly Poly Litter Box. In hindsight, I wish I had gotten the larger size, but the regular works just fine. I was concerned that, in spite of the outward appearance, the actual litter area is about the size of a shoebox. However, my two cats adjusted to it in less than a day. No more rakes to clean. A smart tap on the base after you roll it, and any clumps that are stuck drop right off. No wasted litter, no litter kicked out of the box, no scoops to mess with. I took the advice of a previous review and reinforced the clamps with binder clips. This is WELL WORTH the price!!!I should add, when my mother bought one she couldn't get it to work right. Every time she rolled it, half the litter was dumped in the receptacle. It turned out she was rolling it too fast, and too far. all it takes is a gentle roll just past the perpendicular. I've had this for many months now and still can't say enough good things about it. Greatest invention in the world!",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking

"I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does. It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland). I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better. I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).

"Well, I've finally found a toy that I'm satisfied with for Baby Montana. Hokey Pokey Elmo is actually pretty cool (retails for less than Amazon at Toys R' Us), and is much less annoying than ""Get Dressed Elmo"" or ""Baby Up Up Elmo"" both of whom I can't wait for Montana to accidentally drop off of a cliff (problem there - yes - how do I safely get my 17 month old alongside of a cliff to discard those Elmo dolls who just repeat a bunch of annoying sayings until you have to un-velcro Elmo's back and turn him off). Hokey Pokey Elmo really does shake it all about (on a hard surface) and Montana has a lot of fun spinning around doing the Hokey Pokey. It's actually kind of adorable when he falls over because when you pick up the doll, it thanks you. So, Montana gets to enjoy a singing and dancing doll which automatically stops when the song is over and Montana gets to choose whether or not she wants to hear the song again (unlike Pinkie Pie - the strangely satanic blinking my little pony doll that is just a total yenta;))",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures

"I love this product and probably would no longer have a workable stroller if not for it. When my son was 3 months old we traveled from Okinawa, Japan to Memphis, TN. When he was 4 months old we made the journey back to Okinawa. When he was 4 1/2 months old we flew back to the US. Needless to say, it's been well used and likewise probably well abused. There are no holes in it, the zipper is still working wonderfully, and there are no complaints to speak of as far as the condition of it goes. All 3 trips were made by myself. It is a little awkward to get the stroller into it by yourself but definitely do-able. I used the entire travel system while traveling, and when I had the stroller out I would just fold the bag up (kind of, more like a couple folds then rolling the rest of the way) and stick it between the car seat and the stroller. Fits great there :) We will be moving to England in 2 weeks and will be using this bag.Great purchase!! I had to gate check the carseat on one leg, and it got filthy! This bag keeps the stroller clean and in one piece! An extra bonus is that you can put other stuff in it. I carried our Boppy and my purse back through security and would throw them in the bag before boarding. LOVE this product!

"I read the other reviews and believed them. My mistake. After forty minutes of rollerblading the stuff was in my eyes. As it was after forty minutes of kettlebell exercises on my roof.I have had melanoma. I am a personal trainer. So called previous waterproof, sweatproof products did exactly the same thing. It is NOT advised that one rollerblade with eyes closed, yet that happens briefly. The stuff burns the eyes.So this review is really relevant for people who are active and athletic. These so-called sweatproof products work for about forty minutes and then fail. So I've devised some other solutions. Currently I am covering my forehead with fabric treated with sunprotection and applying the product beneath the eyes. [I always wear large lensed photochromatic goggleish glasses which protect the eyes from sun damage.] Another way to go would be, I think, skydiving or ski goggles that actually seal the eye area from moisture[I think - I haven't tried them yet], or, perhaps, swimming goggles.

"I like this. It has a classic look, it's a decent shave, I'll have it for years - no more throwing away cartriges (those things are getting too expensive these days) and it's not too expensive. At first I was nervous and bought a stiptic pencil to go with - all the other reviews said to go easy or you'll peel your face off. But that didn't happen. When I went easy, it barely worked. I still recommend that folks treat it with respect, but don't be afraid of it. I have to press mine down and find just the right angle. But once that's there it shaves as close if not closer than the most popular blade on the market - the Mach 3. I used one on each side of my face once I got the hang of the Merkur and the Merkur was a closer shave. I'm letting my face have a transition period because every time I change brands or types of blade I get razor burn for the first week and alternating for a couple weeks keeps that from happening. So in about three days I'll be over to the Merkur full time. Plus I spent $30 on cartriges for the Mack 3 and don't want those going to waste.And get some of the Colonel Conk shaving products to go with it. It's the best deal around.Col.

"I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor.

"I've had this Norelco for about 2 years. It is now close to dead because it will not hold a charge beyond a single use. Since the battery on this and other Norelco's cannot be replaced, it is essentially a minimally useful product. It does cut well, thought the height adjuster band can easily slip from a 5 to a 2 -- a disaster if it happens to you in mid-cut. One would expect that by this time, after all Norelco's experience, they'd have worked the battery bugs out and provide at least an optional power cord when the battery finally gives up the ghost. This my second such Norelco, and my last until they either allow replaceable batteries or a power cord and a better rechargeable battery.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal
"At one of our Brio Birth classes we were talking about easing discomforts of pregnancy, and the instructor mentioned Papaya Enzyme as a heartburn remedy. I decided to try it out. I've had heartburn pretty much all through my second trimester, so I've had many opportunities to use these. They work very well.If I already have heartburn, I chew three tablets. If I anticipate getting heartburn--like, there was a while where every time I would lie down in bed at night I would get heartburn--then, I chew two before the heartburn starts, and that prevents it. It works almost immediately.Last week I got a cold and I pulled out the list of ""pregnancy approved medications"" that my midwife gave me at my first prenatal appointment to see what I could take for my cold. I also noticed that under the ""Heartburn"" section, she had listed papaya enzyme as well.I highly recommend papaya enzyme to any other pregnant ladies who are dealing with heartburn!

"I have a 2 year old black lab and when he was a 6 month old puppy we went through 3 other more flimsy plastic frisbees in about 3 months while teaching him how to play catch. Then I went on Amazon and researched the best and longest lasting type of frisbee. I bought 2 of these and after a little over a year and a half of playing catch literally no less than 4 or 5 times a week for 20 minutes at a time, my dog is excellent at catching this frisbee and the 2nd frisbee, other than have several teeth marks here and there, still flies great! I wouldn't recommend letting the frisbee lay around the house though. That is the only reason the first one is no longer around (he chewed it up like it was a raw hide). And watch that your dog picks up the frisbee from the side rather than biting it in the middle which would fold the frisbee in half. Folding the frisbee doesn't damage it but it is a good way for the dog to rip a chunk out of the middle if he keeps picking it up that way. Frisbee flies and glides at a slow enough pace that the dog can catch it every time so your dog only needs to be a medium speed dog to catch it.",pet supplies,dogs,toys

"I have chin-length fine, straight hair. My mother, rest her soul, must be laughing loud and long at the idea of moi, who only ever wanted curly hair, using a straightener. However, it turns out that fine, straight hair is actually acceptable as long as it is smooth. Who knew? So I've been using a straightener for about a year now. My previous straightener is also a Remington, with plain ceramic plates. I've been pretty pleased with it -- my only quibble has been that I have occasionally accidentally turned it off while styling, and have occasionally been unable to turn it off using the ""on/off"" button and had to unplug it.I was eager to try this straightener because of the ""50% less damage""-causing teflon fiber plates. I also kinda hoped they'd fixed the button problem. Bottom line -- the fiber plate is a bit odd. It gives more ""traction"" and so hair, at least fine, straight hair, doesn't slide through as quickly. I think it will be some time before any evaluation of 'less damage' can be made, although damage wasn't a big problem with my previous straightener. And the buttons are a disaster.On my old straightener, the ""temperature up"" and ""temperature down"" buttons were on the hinge side of the display. On this model, they are smaller and on the open side of the display and basically, at least for me, act as grippy little divots into which my fingers naturally fall as I style. And this causes the unit to change temperature, which I could stand, if it didn't beep. But it beeps when the temperature changes. Having to fix one's hair in the morning is bad enough without the stress of knowing you are randomly changing the temperature of your straightening iron, and it is beeping at you about it. Aaaagggghhhhh! It is possible to lock the temperature (although one does so by pressing and holding the ""minus"" key, not by the method given in the printed directions), but you then have to unlock it to turn the appliance off. Aaaaaggghhhhh!In summary:Pro* Fabric plate provides more ""traction"" which may be a benefit to some and may cause less damage* Unit heats up quickly* There is a hinge lock so unit is easier to transport* Dual voltage for international travelCon* Temperature set buttons are impossible to avoid while styling* Locking the buttons is a time-consuming on and off process that has to be done each time you use the straightener* Blue backlight on display is impossible to see in the type of decent lighting one hopes for when styling one's hair (backlight flashes while unit is heating, stays steady when temperature is reached and you can see those things happen if you darken the room and wait for them)* Unit communicates with annoying beepsTo me, what would make sense, is a straightener whose temperature I can set once and then lock and each time I turn the thing on, it goes to that temperature. Do people really fiddle with the temperature that much? The on/off button would be on the hinge side of the display and so would be hard to press while styling, and the display would change to something like ""READY"" when temperature is reached. As things stand, I'm going back to the old, non-beeping unit in hopes that this dream machine will surface!",beauty,hair care,styling tools

"I purchased the Kid Galaxy My First Radio Control Excavator for my 3 yr. old grandson in large part because of the excellent reviews from other buyers. My grandson loved the toy but the performance has been very inconsistent. If the car was inadvertently left on, it would suddenly come to life and move as though being controlled by an extraterrestrial being. On the other hand, when we actually wanted the toy to move, the remote sometimes worked and sometimes didn't, depending on who picked it up, and perhaps on the time of day. We were never able to figure out the system even though several people with college degrees were involved in solving the problem. The thing that I am most unhappy about is the difficulty I've had getting any resolution to the problem either in the way of an exchange or a refund since the holiday season is now over. The IDigToy company claims that I exceeded the 2 week return time frame since I purchased the toy for Christmas a couple of weeks before and by the time the gift was opened on Christmas Day, it was already too late for the return. This is a terrible policy. I think Amazon is working on helping me resolve this, but I will definitely NOT be purchasing another toy from that particular company. I am terribly disappointed in the whole situation.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown
"This is a fine product, designed by people who know cats and cat owners. Quality materials and good craftsmanship. I was impressed right out of the box. It took a while to assemble and set up, but once I figured it all out the unit performed perfectly. Another reviewer stressed watching the video over using the docs for assembly, and I agree, although there are very useful diagrams in the docs. My only advice is if your unit comes with a power adapter that plugs into the side of the unit you can ignore the entire first segment of the video. After that, the video guides you expertly and confidently through set up and in very short order to your first feeding cycle.My cats have ""endured"" 4 feeding cycles now. They'll be getting food 6 times a day (every 4 hours) with the first feeding of the day shortly after midnight and the last around 8 pm. We're hoping this solves the problem of our cats dramatic and tyrannical entrance into our sleep cycles starting around 4 am each day, and ending only when they get fed. So far they're eating cautiously but I'm confident they'll adapt.It's too soon to tell if the Super Feeder will solve the problem, but if you're looking for a quality, well-made-in-America product for feeding small pets you can't go wrong with the Super Feeder.********************UPDATE**********************I'm adding an update that in no way downgrades my previous review, but provides information I didn't have when I bought the unit - information that might have made a difference in my purchase decision, had I known. In a nutshell, my female cat, after hours of study, figured out how to get kibble out of the autofeeder anytime she wanted. Basically, she shoved a paw up through the chute and pawed at the rollers causing the unit to ""leak"" out a few kibble. She'd eat that and repeat the process, over and over again. She was able to empty the hopper with a few hours work. The reason we got this unit was because the female had gotten fat from our having left food down all the time (which we did because she woke us up at night if her bowl was empty). We needed a way to feed her periodically so she got no more than she should, and yet had food often enough that she didn't go on the attack pestering us to feed her. For almost a year this product did the trick - but now that she's figured out how to game it she's getting fat again, and so the product is no longer of any use to us. We boxed it up and sold it at a yard sale, with a note inside telling the new owner what will happen if their cats are as smart as our female is (we suspect the male is as dim as a birthday candle, with an attention span that burns for about the same duration - but he's a happy soul, so we don't mind - in fact we frequently wish the female wasn't quite so smart!). We still feel the unit is a good one, but only if you have rather dim witted cats... :-)",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies

"I bought this when I was about 20 weeks pregnant and beginning to get uncomfortable. What a relief! Now, with that said, I must say that it did not remove all of my discomfort but it was reduced by at least 85%. I like the fact that it surrounds me and I do not have to re-adjust when I roll over. My partner and I have it in a queen bed and he still has a decent amount of room for him to sleep (sometimes he likes to snuggle up on it too). He is about 5'10 and 185lbs.A potential problem I can see is for the taller ladies... I am very small (5 foot and was about 120lbs prepregnancy) ... when I try to put my head on the upper pillow part and put my arm under it (under my head), I can feel the seem pushing into my shoulder/neck area. This is not an issue for me, but I think if I were a little bigger it may cause some discomfort. Its length is good and I think for anyone, even the taller ladies, if you sleep with your legs slightly bent there is plenty of pillow for support.Also, as I am getting bigger the inside contoured portion is really helpful to support my belly.",baby products,pregnancy maternity,maternity pillows

"I purchased the V tech smile game and machine about 4 years ago. After 2 years it just quit. It wouldn't power on, it was just dead.Recently I decided to purchase a second one as we have over 10 games. The machine worked for an hour and then it quit, again there was no power. In frustration I returned it to the store for a new one and the machine quit again after a few minutes of game play.In all situations the systym would not turn on again after we changed games. I took a game cartridge and pushed it down to expose the hardware and I blew my breath on it several times. I inserted the game again, unpluged and repluged the cord and it worked again.Sooooooooo what I realized was that my games were dusty and wouldn't play in the machine. I quickly blew on all the games and then every one of them worked. I got out my 4 year old game systym, plugged it back in and put in a new game that I had blown the dust off and it worked. The entire problem of the machine acting like it was dead was because the game cartridges were dusty!!!!! We do have to unplug and plug in the game systym to get it working again.I have read that many people have trouble with the machine just dying without warning. I think if you just blow the dust off the games, unplug and plug the cord back in, then your machine will work again.Big relief to me as we really enjoy the learning aspects of this game.",toys games,electronics for kids,systems accessories

"I got my kids this game last christmas and we've played several times. It's really cute that everyone has to reach ""under the bed"" and try to pull out an item that's on their card (dirty diaper, smelly sock, rotten orange, etc...). The catch is that you can't spend too long b/c if the monster (that growls and makes comments like, ""hey, who's there"") pops up and someone has their hand under his bed, you have to clear your card of everything you've found. The good thing about this game is that it is good for younger players too since you can turn the monster feature off so that younger players have more time without getting scared when the monster pops up. The bad thing is that the monster is hard to push back down and get him to stay down so you can resume playing after he pops up. After we played several times, the monster was nearly impossible to get to stay down and once he did...he's never popped back up again (although, he will make the occasional groan or growl). The bed falls apart kind of easily if you pick it up to move it. However, my daughter has found it a very cute bed for many of her dolls and she loves that the ""pillow"" lifts up so that you can hide stuff in the bed, so it's been a fun toy for her. We may have just gotten a defective one or one that wasn't made very well. It is such a cute, fun game and the kids like it just thinking that the monster may pop up that we continue to play it and it would probably be worth the money if your family has a ""game night"" like we do.",toys games,games,board games

"I just purchased this Leap Pad for my 4 year old son. We have 2 other leap pad systems, the My first leap pad and the original leap pad system. When I previously bought those systems for my son he was'nt ready to learn to write. Now however, he is old enough for this system and after a lot of attempts to get him to practice letters and practice writing his name I could'nt get him to really pay attention to me to write his letters, he would get bored and be ready to quit trying. I then decided on getting the Leap Pad System Plus Writing.When I went to purchase it, I saw the Leap Pad Plus Writing Plus Microphone System that also included 2 books. I could'nt find a price, so I picked it up and put it in the cart to see how much it cost, to my great surprise it was the same amount of money as the Leap Plus Writing. (I don't think any other store carries the Leap Pad Writing and Microphone system except Toys R Us) So I was even more pleased that it had an additional feature of the microphone.When I got home and opened it up for my son to start writing and playing with it, I was really surprised at how easy it was for him to hold the pencil stylus and he quickly traced the letters on the pages almost flawlessly! He loved it, he loved how the letters made sounds, for instance the letter I will say I-I-I-ICKY as you trace over it. He laughs each time a letter talks as he is tracing over them. Then we began playing with the microphone feature I never dreamed how much enjoyment he'd get out of this feature! It is a huge plus to have the microphone! One of the starter books that came with it has several pages that you can use the microphone on it, there is one page that you make a car sound and it uses your voice to sound like its starting the car on the page. Its really funny to get the sounds on the page with my son's voice. He laughs and giggles and it keeps him occupied for at least an hour at a time! Learning letters and learning to write has never been more fun until we bought this system. It is a WONDERFUL system and I can't say enough good things about it. If you are thinking of getting a leap pad for your child, go with the writing and microphone. If you think your child is not old enough yet for the writing feature, just take out the lead in the pencil. Another really great thing about the leap pad writing system, if you purchase any of the leap pad writing books they come with a new pencil with lead.Another thing about this system, its more compact than the original leap pad, its very sturdy and it also comes with an eraser storage pocket and an eraser for the writing books. I figured the pencil would have an eraser on the end of it, but they don't instead they made a big eraser, easier for smaller kids to erase off their pages to re use them or to correct thier mistakes and a handy storage pocket to keep your eraser handy at all times.Another thing I noticed about the system is the pencil stylus stays put once its snapped in the system, the other leap pads we have the stylus is hard to get to stay. They made this leap pad very durable and I agree with another reviewer- this is the ""cadallic of all leap pads!""This system is worth every penny I paid for it. My 4 year old is already mastering writing words and has learned to spell several new words because of this system. I am so pleased with this leap pad, I would highly reccommend it!!!",toys games,electronics for kids,systems accessories

I searched online and found Blue Lizard which contains both.During a week's vacation on Cape Cod, I applied Blue Lizard once daily and it was highly effective.

People often only applied it to their noses to prevent burning.Although Blue Lizard goes on white -- it isn't as thick and opaque as the old products -- the white *mostly* fades as it dries and is absorbed into the skin. It feels a bit oily but I found that the single application was effective even when I swam in the ocean -- I assume the oiliness was a factor in this efficacy.I really appreciate a natural product that doesn't have carcinogens or is otherwise harmful for sensitive skin. I won't buy anything but Blue Lizard in future.",beauty,skin care,sun

"Purchase this as an extra set after receiving Sony charger. The lesson came very soon. I had to rush to a nearby 7/11 minutes before an event. The Olympus DSC showed ""low bat"" on the 2700maH batteries (came with the charger) after few shots and didn't even like the 2500maH spares that were charged 2 to 3 days prior.I have done some research and weekly experiments. I refreshed and re-charged repeatedly and measures in-between. The voltage dropped from the ~1.4V to ~1.2V within 3 days on all 8 of them. One tech paper stated that NiMH batteries do lose 1% of their charges in 24 hours at room temp when not in use. The Sony ones must have far exceeded the typcial case. It's winter time in Calfornia and the moisture doesn't come into play.I read all the reviews before the purchases.

"Amazon notes that these bags are easy to life and carry--and they are right. The black color of the bags helps to make your refuse more private, too. This is important in this day of identity theft. The bags have drawstrings that you should draw tight and then tie; but I recommend that you also tie the very top part of the actual black bag itself for extra strength so it definitely won't break when you take out the garbage.Hefty lives up to its name as being extra strong. I tried several store brands but none of them were as thick and durable as Hefty. In my opinion Hefty is the brand to buy. The 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great for both families and single people.The bags are economical, too. At the Amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each and that's a good deal especially because a bag can usually handle two days' worth of garbage.Highly recommended.",health personal care,household supplies,paper plastic

Very frustrating in the middle of the night!!The only good thing about them is that everything comes apart to throw in the dishwasher, and the bottles are dry at the end of the cycle because the bottom is removed. I just let the individual little pieces air dry and reassemble -- and hope that they don't leak the next time...I complained to Playtex, and they weren't extremely helpful or nice, and made it seem as though it was my baby that couldn't figure out how to use the bottle!!

With the large opening on the top of the sorter babies can begin by putting in and taking out the blocks. As they mature, they can advance to using the shape holes on the sides.

I'm going to continue to use them, because they're fun & easy. However, for now, at home, I'm using training pants that are handwashable.

He'd much rather spend his time moving his trains around the tracks and over mountains and bridges (a much better way to spend your Thomas money, if you ask me). This piece is overpriced for what it is and you really need the round-about turntable to go with it (so, add an additional thirty to the cost).

This is my second purchase of the 360 Waterpic in two years. The first lasted 12 months before the battery gave out. (Note- The batteries can not be replaced.) I called the customer service department at Waterpic with no satisfaction. I bought a second one last year and with the same results. After 11 months it to gave out because of the battery. I would think with all the complaints the manufacture has received about the short life span of this 360W Waterpic they would have done something. It seems they just don't care! I just purchased a different waterpic made by ToiletTree it has a 4 star rating by comsumers. Hopefully this will last more than 11 months.,health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene

"These were a horrible choice for our two year old daughter. When we started using these she broke out in a horrible rash and it has been so painful for her that we have to bathe her every time she has a bowel movement because wiping just seems to be too painful. Not everyone has this reaction according to the other parent reviews, but some do, so that should be taken into consideration. My daughter has only had a diaper rash one other time when we tried using the huggies pull ups. Those seemed to disagree with her skin also. Pampers Easy Ups is what we normally use and I think we will stick with those until she is done with potty training.",baby products,diapering,disposable diapers
"I was surprised to see several reviewers who said, ""salt is salt is salt, right?"". WRONG! That refined salt in the grocery store is extremely damaging to your body, causing many problems like high blood pressure for one.Your body desperately needs natural salt, but the refined versions most of us grew up with have had all the nutrients processed out of them. There are something like 70 or 80 trace elements in a good sea salt that are essential for your body's health. Under ideal conditions, we would receive these from our food we eat. But in today's world, the soil is depleted of these critical nutrients - so that even if you try to eat good natural food, it no longer contains what you need. So sea salt to the rescue.Having learned all this a few years back, I bought some Redmond's and gave it a try - and promptly went into shock. I knew it would be good for me, but I still expected it to taste the same as all salt - but it was, ""OMG! THIS IS WHAT SALT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE??!!!"" It was a delightful bouquet of flavors and so satisfying to the taste buds. Even if regular salt wasn't so bad for you, I could never go back just because of the taste - there is no comparison.And don't be fooled by most grocery store brands - even Morton's sells sea salt - and it tastes just like the same old crap that's been in our salt shakers all these years.One other tip to try",grocery gourmet food,herbs,spices seasonings

"This is an excellent massager, with many benefits if used consistently. Initially, I didn't like this massager compared to the original Panasonic Easy Reach massager I had. When that faithful, and great working massager broke last year (after using it for nearly 7 years), I was dismayed to find it had been replaced with this one, which is very different in design from the original. But I bought this one anyway, and decided to give it a try. After trying to use it like the old one a few times, I was very disappointed. It was nothing like it, and much heavier, and harder to move around easily.But then, after setting this massager aside, and trying another new massager for a bit (and being disappointed), I decided to give this Panasonic one more try. I also decided to use the first massage setting at the initial slow speed, and to move, or hold it in one small circular area for one full cycle before moving it to another area. I did this when I was suffering from severe bronchitis, and it helped to encourage my body to cough out the mucus in my lungs every day. As a result, I felt much better after a couple of weeks of daily massaging. In addition, it stimulates my sluggish lymphatic flow under my arms, and in my chest, encouraging drainage. This has helped to alleviate the bad swelling in my upper torso and joints, and greatly decrease the edema in my legs. In addition, one full body massage can put me into a deep state of relaxation so that I can sleep much better. As a result, with regular massages, I am beginning to look, and feel much better as my body gets detoxified, and I get more healing sleep!There is a definite trick to using this massager effectively, however, and this is how I do it",health personal care,health care,massage relaxation

"After seeing the Gentle Leader in action before I got my own dog, I was already convinced that it would work. My dog (a 40 lb. rescue) is a puller, and while I originally got a harness for him, I felt that the Gentle Leader would ultimately be the best thing to use. It arrived today, and the difference was instantaneous. Sure, he's not a fan of the feeling on his face (he paws at it trying to get it off) but the walks have been more leisurely and enjoyable - I walk at MY pace, not his. Before when I had to hold the leash tightly wrapped around my hand, now I can literally hold it between two fingers.

"I love split pea soup, and normally I make it from scratch, but it can take an hour or more. When I saw that this product cooked in a mere 10 minutes, I was pretty excited. I figured it was probably composed of cooked and freeze-dried peas that basically just needed to be reconstituted, and of course some kind of seasoning. I didn't read the ingredients on the bag, though, until I got home. Oops.Reading the list of ingredients, I was immediately skeptical. The first thing listed was modified corn starch. Corn starch?! Split peas create a thick enough soup, I can't imagine why they needed corn starch, let alone why they had to use more corn starch, by weight, than actual PEAS. I went ahead and prepared it anyway, figuring it would surely at least be edible.Well, it was edible. It was pretty salty, but I could live with that. It was the texture I just couldn't take. This soup has the mouthfeel of a soup thickened with corn starch (surprise, surprise)--like egg drop soup at a chinese restaurant. Which is fine for egg drop soup, but I found it utterly impossible to reconcile with my conception of split pea soup.

"Boy oh boy. Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation.I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far. What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric. Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible.I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with. But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop. I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff. Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled ""lite"" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk.",grocery gourmet food,sauces dips,sauces

I bought this comb hoping it would work as a last resort. This and tea tree oil and olive oil worked.We also used the electric nit comb that zaps the bugs. But this comb was really what we needed in the first place. The spaces are so tiny it actually grabs every egg in the hair. I don't really understand why the shampoo kits don't include this comb or even sell this comb in a retail store. This comb was even better than the metal comb we bought at Sally's beauty supply store.... I highly recommend it. After weeks of checking for lice and reapplying shampoo and cream.

"I've never tried any other brands of pre-electric shave conditioner, but I was so displeased with my new electric shaver that I decided to give Afta a try; I chose the ""Fresh"" scent. (It's kind of a silly name, since ""Afta"" makes you think of ""after,"" and you're supposed to use it ""before""!)Afta has given me a dramatically closer shave, and one that is more comfortable, too. It made the difference between an unacceptable shave and an acceptable one.As the bottle says, it is a non-greasy formula. It doesn't appear to clog the razor heads, also as claimed. I've only been using it for three weeks, so it may be too early to tell.The only drawback, which I consider minor, is that the fragrance is rather strong. It reminds me of an inexpensive after shave lotion. It doesn't dissipate with my post-shave rinse with water; you would probably need to wash with soap and water to make it completely go away.However, I'm so pleased with the improvement in quality of my shave that the lingering aroma doesn't bother me in the least.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal

"Sixteen reviews of an elephant, and not a one says anything about size. Amazon's descriptionssays its ""18"" H. I'm sorry, but measuring his height while he's seated (as his designers obviously intended, yields a compact 7"". By pulling, and even slightly stretching him from the tip of his trunk to his rear feet, another 5 inches can be coaxed from him. So consider him 7"" or, if you prefer, 12"" (providing you steamroller him into a flattened, distorted shape), but if you're looking for something closer to the the size of the true king of the beasts, look elsewhere and be prepared to spend more.It's puzzling that several reviewers claim he looks nothing like his picture (or that he's a slightly faded color, etc.). My Ty Winks Elephant, as delivered on Good Friday, is absolutely identical with his picture. Those who register great disappointment on this account either received the wrong order from Amazon or purchased from a less responsible seller. In any case, if you buy Winks from Amazon and find him different from the pictured one, Amazon will be happy to refund your costs, including postage from and to.The same might apply in my case because of Amazon's false size specification (probably a typo). But as currently priced, I think he's fairly valued. And he's twice the size of the Ty miniatures going for five bucks. Moreover, the manufacturer can usually be counted on to make good, durable products, and Winks appears to be no exception. The eyes are small, black, securely anchored droplets. If I have any disappointment, it's that while writing this review I've been watching those opaque little eyes carefully, and neither one has winked. Still, I much prefer this to the animal I initially selected, then promptly removed from my cart upon discovering that it comes with a ""bonus"" in the form of a ""virtual"" twin on the internet, available to the lucky tot who remembers the password. That's one expendable word as well as one place my grandkids (or this kid) don't need to know more about. The thought that the website expenses were reflected, at least in part, in the product's cost was in itself sufficient to make Winks a highly preferable alternative.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures

Not sure of the licensing history, but this is one of the original sets. Most of the dark green items are, and many of the animals have been around quite awhile. CC use standard dollhouse scale, which means you can mix them with a lot of other sets, too. The bathroom and kitchen sets, which have been updated, had the most play value, and the bunkbed was great, too. The houses are expensive, and cramped, but an old or cheap bookcase that can be wallpapered or painted makes a great house/storage unit.

However, it's not at all hot or tangy. but rather a delicious blend of fruit and spices (especially tasty on chicken, we've found).- Gail Cooke",grocery gourmet food,sauces dips,sauces
"As others have already said the convenience is the thing. Sure it is nice that it seems to be one of the more accurate meters around but the real impact for me is that testing is now so convenient I don't resist doing it anymore. With other meters fiddling around with test strips was frustrating and I always had to go find them. This just sits by my chair, in the car, in my jacket and I can do a test in a matter of seconds. I now test more frequently - I even test when I'm just curious about the impact of a meal or a workout or whatever. I never did that before because it was just too much hassle.I have much better control now and it is entirely down to this meter.I also have the USB adapter to download the data and it is excellent (it has a small thumb drive built in so all the software you need is already on the device...plug and play). It's easy to use and gives very informative reports and charts (I especially like the metabolic control chart). I can dump a two week* report from the meter and have it sent off to my endocronologist in less than a minute! No more manual logbooks for me! The only caution I offer is that I have found problems with using Internet Explorer with the device, the formatting gets messed up. Since I do Web development I have 5 different browsers on my PC so I setup a shortcut with FireFox and I just launch from an icon, click on read device, and start the meter transmitting (press M & S togeter when it is turned off). It is done in seconds.The reports/charts produced are:Trend graph",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,health monitors

"Produces too little steam for my ""taste"".Even if the manufacturer believes that's all the steam anybody needs, or should take, I don't think it's too hard to put an option of generating more steam for people like me.Other than the quantity of steam produced by this thing, everything else seems okay. The quality of material used, the shape and the way it fits on the mouth/nose etc.But because of the amount of steam produced, I almost never use it so I am not a great judge of other factors.Overall for me personally it ended up being a waste of money.",health personal care,health care,allergy

We had one of these for our Jack Russell (Rustam) and our Aussi Cattle dog (Paro) would wait for him to step out at night and get in it to go to sleep. This made Rustam come to our bed.

I like the fact that we can remove the doors so we are not hitting it or knocking then shut.

Well, they go through 8-10 a day. I was changing this every other day, and it's definately not easy to change. Then you throw in the refills that cost a fortune and this is just not practical.

"The only good thing about this tub is the sling. I used this tub for only two months before it started leaking. At first it was sporadic, then it was constant. I don't know why because I never did anything different. So I called Safety First and they said they get several phone calls every day about this problem. First they made me think the leaking was my fault b/c I wasn't opening the tub all the way. When I told them the tub was open all the way and leaking, they arranged for an exchange (you remove and send back the suction cups and drain plug to the company and they send you a new tub). Since I'm not willing to try again with the 4-in-1 (my son loves bathtime and I hate to rush him through it because his tub is running out of water), they're sending me a different tub that doesn't close up for storage. Ever since the leaking started, I've been using the sling in the big tub and my baby is having a blast. The sling is the only good thing about this product. If you're willing to spend [money]for the sling, then buy this product. If you expect a competent tub, then don't. In my opinion, Safety First should sell the sling separately and work on a new model that doesn't leak.",baby products,bathing skin care,bathing tubs seats

Only real downside is, when you're trying to freeball something or just testing things out, it gets really hard to use this kit because you haven't sized everything and laid it out to accept all the right lengths of wire. Honestly if you're just going to use this for college projects or hobby projects I'd get it, but when you are building your projects for the first time, just use regular wire.

"This was one of my most favorite gifts! The bundle me is two seperate pieces one part stays in the car seat and the other zips up to it. If it is really cold out you can zip it all the way to keep your baby warm, when it starts to warm up you can either unzip the top or unzip the bottom to allow air in. Also, It has a little extra materieal on top so if is windy you can cover up your baby's face. A must have for winter babies!!!

"After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store.

I was thrilled to receive my Heat Pad and took it away on holiday with me so that I could use it on my shoulder which had recently had a tendon repair. I needed it to help with pain relief. Imagine my great disappointment when I found the plug was not compatable in New Zealand. I would have thought knowing where the item is being sent and to be used that it would come ready to use for that country. I should have sent it back instead decided to take it to have a new plug put on so that I could use. Unfortunately for me the engineer that was to do the work removed the plug and prepared the wires for a replacement plug before he read the fact that it wasn't compatable for 240V. I now have a heat pad that is unusable and unreturnable due to the fact it is not in the original condition.I suggest everyone who is purchasing items that you check if it is compatable for your use in your country.

"Crate sounds too close to ""cage,"" and these should never be treated as such. A crate should be considered a den, which you train you puppy to feel safe in and trust you to leave her there and come back. A crate is not to contain a bad animal or get her out of our sight when you tire of her. It is meant as a safe, comforting place for them to sleep, take ""time-outs,"" and to hang out when you need to leave the house. That said, a puppy will only consider a crate a safe happy place if you make it so. Do NOT purchase a crate and simply throw your dog in it, expecting her to take to it; doing so will create a nervous dog with major separation anxiety. It takes patience, encouragement, and most importantly PROPER TRAINING from a young age. That said, let me get to the product.This is our second Midwest folding crate. Our first was a large one for my German Shepherd Mix, bought years ago, when as an adult he decided he loved my roommate's dog's crate, so I bought him one. It lasted the rest of his life, and he was a big, oafish dog, who flopped in and out of it every time. The cat even took to hanging out on top of the crate to be close to him. It held up well, traveled well, assembled and disassembled quickly.Our new Midwest iCrate Double-Door Folding Crate is equal in quality to our last Midwest crate with a few added features",pet supplies,dogs,houses

"I have the old model Diaper Genie and am sooo glad to have one! A few comments:1. Some people claim the refills are too expensive. We get them at WalMart for less than $5 each and each one has lasted more than a month, even with a 7-month-old who poops like it's an Olympic sport. $5 a month is worth it for the convience of not having to change it as much as you would with a garbage bag - which are probably about as expensive.2. Some people say it smells - I can't believe that. Even with our baby eating solid foods and making hideously stinky poops, there is NO odor in our nursery. Not even a little!! I empty it every 7-10 days and there is never, ever an odor coming from it, even when I am sitting next to it playing on the floor with the baby. We switched to the Toddler strength or Stage 2 refills at about 9 months as he started to eat more ""real"" food - still no odors!I love that the Genie is easy to use, easy to empty and refill and that there is no smell at all. We don't use it for wet-only diapers and I would recommend it to everyone with an infant.",baby products,diapering,wipes holders

"I was blown away by the effect this seat had on my daughter! After having a really hard time getting anything done while alone with her, including going to the bathroom, I decided a bouncer/seat was the way to go. I spent forever looking at the reviews on Amazon, and was stuck between this and the Eddie Bauer Soothing Bouncer. I finally packed the baby up and went to the store. I pulled both seats off the shelf, but only got a chance to put her in this one. The second her head touched the incredibly soft fabric, my wide-awake baby was sound asleep. I felt bad making her leave the store - had my husband not been there, we may have had nap time right there in Geoffrey's; she looked too comfortable to move. I didn't even try to put her into the EB seat - I knew right away that this was the way to go. Additionally, after trying to knock over both this seat and the EB one, my husband didn't even make me try it, which is really saying something. The EB one is flimsy; this one didn't move a bit as my husband bumped it from all angles (we have two large dogs). This seat may be the best thing my daughter's gotten yet - I sure love it!

"As soon as I bought this game, my friends and I played it twice. Even if you are already familiar with Risk, some of the new rules might be challenging to learn. However, the new rules generally make the game much more fun. For example, commanders are more effective at attacking, commander cards add new strategies for winning, and the oceans and even the moon can be your battleground.For people new at strategic war games, the new game might seem a little too complex, but the game contains rules for playing with the original &quot;classic&quot; Risk rules, although with different-looking armies.If you're a fan of strategic war games, and especially a fan of Risk, you will greatly enjoy this game.P.S. I gave this game 2 stars for educational value because it encourages strategic thinking but does not really teach anything aside from diplomatic skills. I gave this game 3 stars for durability because after playing the game twice, nothing broke, but all the pieces are plastic, so IMO it's only a matter of time. Also, the tray that holds the plastic pieces is made of a kind of paper-board, so it's not as durable as plastic or styrofoam (such as in &quot;Shogun&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Samurai Swords&quot;).",toys games,games,board games
"Listen all - as a Dad of 2 (19mo & 3mo) these bottles LEAK.It's not nipple age, microwaved, dish-washed, or how your kid sucks it down. It's a matter of how the nipple fits into the cap and how the cap and nipple screw onto the bottle.Trust me, as a dude I went through all of the above. Brand new out of the box or used over 6 months you just have to resign to the fact that these things have a tendency to spill out.DUDE's GUIDE TO LEAKING BOTTLE:A. After filling the bottle's content, cap it and shake or tip the bottle over the sink. Allow contents to spill out of nipple. Then tip the bottle upright. It is at that time you will know if your bottle is leaking or not. If it is leaking, proceed to Step B. If it is not leaking, repeat process a couple more times just to be sure. Feed baby.B. If the bottle does spill or leak, unscrew the cap and use a paper towel or bib and dry the inside threads of the white cap.Dry the external threads of the bottle as well. Screw on cap. Reef on it like you mean it (usually you're PO'd by now so a little agression helps). Repeat Step A.Avent bottles are based of a simple principle of channelling air through the nipple/cap threads rather than having the baby backwash (ala chugging a Dr. Pepper from a bottle). It needs to draw air. While eating, just make sure the nipple is at least 1/2 way in the baby's mouth and his lips/mouth are WIDE open as if he was nursing.These moms that say they have to tip their baby upside down etc. is baloney. Tip the bottle - DUH! And as for air/gas/burping, all babies suck air while nursing/bottle-fed. Babies do that. They still have the breathe-thru-nose-while-eating mechanism after doing the same for months in the womb.So trust me. It takes a little work to understand these things. These ARE good bottles and they DO work. Just be aware of the above.Hope this helps.",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

"I have to agree with previous reviewers that this toy has design issues which make it inappropriate for children under 3 yrs or so. It requires hand strength that 18-36 month olds do not have. Also, there is a significant delay between the child's action of pressing the button and the train starting to move. This is confusing to younger children. He solved the problem himself by sitting on top of the train so that his bum constantly pressed the button, making it go. But this makes the train top-heavy and easily tipped over. So instead, we disabled the original ""on/off"" mechanism and installed a switch (from radio shack). He can very easily flip the switch to turn it on or off. He loves the toy now.",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons

"I use this for so many things its not even funny, here are a few:I use it within an oil concoction for my hair to help with frizziness and it works amazingly well, especially since it helps to lower the ph of many alkaline hair products.On my skin, I use it every night as a sort of face gel after I cleanse to keep it from breaking out and getting too oily. It can be to drying in the winter so I add a few drops, 3-6, of jojoba oil.Occasionally my 3 year old would get small bumps on her face, I apply this at night and by morning she is clear.Whenever I get a cut or scrape I apply the gel and its helps ease the pain quickly even a burn my daughter and I received quite recently from a scalding pot of water.Lastly, I drank this to help better my well being since a good friend of mine with amazing skin mentioned how she would drink this. I never thought to taste it because it looked as if it would not be pleasing but I did and it tastes pretty darn good! I will post later what type of benefits I have received from drinking it but either way I keep a bottle or two in the house!",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

"I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit, so I needed a strong replacement. Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me. There's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it's a tea, you don't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it. For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.The flavor is very herby and grassy. It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink. It's not something that I would order at a restaurant, but the flavor is passable for me so I don't mind drinking it.The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached. I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process. I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.Overall, I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink. It definitely wakes me up and I don't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath, the jitters or an upset stomach.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea
"My daugter is obsessed with anything from the ""My Little Pony"" toy line. I bought this recently for her 5th birthday. She absolutely loved it! It goes together pretty quick. The only complaint would be that the clips that hold the ponies on the butterfly ride fall off pretty easily, but they are easy to hang on, so no big deal. My daughter has been playing with this every day since her birthday last week. It has a lot of fun activities to keep her busy. She especially loves to put the ponies on the carnival-style ride; you just turn the little knob a couple times, push the button, and the fun begins--the ponies get a neat ride, along with fun tropical music that plays during the ride. My 11yr. old daughter and 8yr old son even enjoy playing with it. Not much on educational value, but great for pretend play. The storage compartment for the accessories is great; just make sure the little pieces get put back after playtime, or they could get lost. I would definately recommend this for any little girl or boy or loves the My Little Pony toys.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets
"We picked this up for use with a car seat on a plane ride and it worked out great. I wasn't sure about the soft surface and my husband was concerned that it would be too big and encroach on others but it worked out fine. It was easy to strap across our son and his car seat (much easier than actually trying to get the carseat latched into the airplane seat). There are latches on both sides of the wrap-around strap so it is easy to attach no matter what side the car seat is on. The surface was able to hold our laptop to watch a movie. There was room on either side of the car seat to let the side flaps down and those would have been handy for his water bottle and toys, if it had been a longer flight. We were able to fold up the tray and stick it with the car seat into the car seat carrier we use to carry the carseat through the airport. We haven't used it in the car as yet, but it would have been very handy on a road trip last summer . . . :-)",baby products,car seats accessories,accessories

I like the material and construction design - simple but functional. I can't attest to actual durability because my dog hasn't yet spent any time on it. I can get him up on it and lie down but turn my back and he hops off. Can't fault the bed but every dog is different and was the risk I took. Also note that I believe the product is true to the size given but if your dog is larger than average for his breed (as mine is) then err on the side of buying a larger bed. My dog can get up and lie down but can't really stretch out much or his head/paws hang off the side. I gave 5 stars because I'm pleased with the purchase and the product - Too bad my dog isn't as thrilled with it as I am.

"For over $100 this toy is a JOKE. Yes, it is HUGE, and impressively so. Getting this on Christmas morning was like the greatest thing ever for my 3 year old daughter. Its a giant castle that is in the garish purples and loud pinks and yellows from the ""Enchanted Tales"" line of Princess products. For a girl that wants a big castle to play with her princesses in, it seems perfect. It's huge, has neat things like a working elevator and balcony, and several pieces of furniture including a lamp with shade, bed, sofa, table and chairs. Any of the standard size Disney Princess dolls seem to fit it (she has Gem Princess and Enchanted Tales dolls).HOWEVER, it is flimsy. Parts starting breaking, first with the balcony and then legs of the chairs snapping off. We tried two different superglues to get them to stick but finally gave up. Then the table top came off, the lamp came apart, the bathtub shed a foot. For a product that retailed for over $100 this is inexcusable and horribly disappointing. So many accessories and pieces broke off of it that my daughter doesn't even play with it much anymore. She parks her horses in the left empty side that opens the castle up and that's about it now.If you can get it on sale, it's an impressive piece. Just don't expect it to be sturdy and do have some glue on hand (and hopefully better brands than the super glues we used).",toys games,dolls accessories,playsets
"When I first tried these confections many years ago (in the early 90's) I instantly loved them. They are toasted sesame seeds bound together with a honey glazing. That is all - honey and sesame seeds. But boy are they good and addictive. The only negative side to this treat is that the four individual wafers contained in each package tend to stick together and sometimes they do not break away cleanly from each other. This is to be expected though given the nature of the ingredients and is a small inconvenience. The product is made in, of all places, Poland and I find it gratifying to be able to purchase a product from a country that has come so far, economically and socially, in the last 20 years.

"I have 2 of these car seats and absolutely love them. I started out with the travel system baby car seats and this was the first one I bought when it was time to turn our baby around. My daughter loved this seat. She was comfortable and made the car rides much more pleasant since she didn't like the car too much before the marathon. The seat is so easy to adjust the straps and to install. The thing that I like the best is the clip that the seat belt goes through to help tighten and hold the car seat in place better. I always had a hard time installing the baby seat and keeping it in place. it always seemed to move more than an inch side to side. This seat was and still is the best. When my son was born we bought one for him too. I feel like Britax is so safe and made so good that why not have the best, especially when it comes to our childrens safety. Can't skimp on that. Now i just purchased the roundabout for my 3rd. I really wanted another marathon. Especially since they go up to 65 pounds with the 5-point harness. We went with the roundabout so we could fit 3 seats on the same seat. The marathon is so wide that i would never been able to fit 3 in a row. I havent used it yet since I bought it today but im sure it will be just as good since it is Britax.

"""Whisper"" is a strange name to choose for this pump, because it sounds more like a mini-jackhammer. Almost immediately after I began using it, the thing went from reasonably quiet to obnoxiously loud. I opened it up and found that the magnet used inside to create the pumping motion was poorly attached to its metal arm. I used some aquarium silicone to better fasten it and dampen vibration. That helped, but I've found since then that it's gotten noisy again and I haven't been able to fix it, this time.

I can't remember why I purchased colloidal silver but I had some in my medicine cupboard. I faintly remember one of my best friends telling me that it worked for sore throats. I of course had forgotten about that until day three of being sick when I was looking through my medicine cabinet for some sinus medication. I had run out of Theraflu so my husband went out and bought DayQuil. That didn't work as well so I ended up buying more Theraflu.Still I was not feeling completely well until I took 1/2 a teaspoon of colloidal silver. Within two days and only two doses I felt amazingly better. Normally I get sick once or twice a year and it seems to last for weeks. This time I was sick for less than a week and that is a great improvement. Later I found out that colloidal silver is actually a natural antibiotic. It will kill all types of viruses and bacteria.Please consult with your doctor before taking this product. It is not recommended that you take this for more than 10 days at a time. It really worked for me so I can highly recommend this product.~The Rebecca Review,health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

They're pretty good at soaking up pee, but we were really pleased with the padding.We'd tried other brands, and they were almost too fluffy. The puppies' nails were getting stuck in the material and snagging. The pups didn't know whether to pee on them or to wad them up and used them as pillows (they actually preferred the latter). And other brands didn't soak up the pee - it either pooled on top or soaked straight through onto the floor.The Hartz pads soak up the pee fairly quickly, so no puppy paws are tracking it across the floor.

"I am absolutely pleased with this item!! I was a little skeptical at first since it was so cheap compared to other sites and pet stores, but I give this item 100% satisfaction!! Our cats love it! The only downfall (which isn't the company's fault, it's the fault of the FURminator maker's) is that there aren't any directions. It doesn't tell you how often you should use the product, how much pressure to use, how long the blade lasts, or even how to use the FURminator. We use the FURminator about once a week on both of our cats (both short-haired tabby's) and it seems to keep the shedding down, at least for one of our cats... the other cat, has a MAJOR shedding problem, and this seems to help a little bit, but maybe we just need to use it more often on her. Either way, it does still help!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any cat owner!! Not only does it help eliminate a lot of shedding, it leaves your cat's coat super shinny and soft!",pet supplies,cats,grooming

"Like most multi level marketing companys the first thing they need is a quality product. I'm not sure they found one with this product. Unfortunately I fell for the hype surrounding this product. I was feeling a lot better after struggling with candida for eight years. I was taking Candi Gone, probiotics and enzymes as well as a strict candida diet. I added the Fivelac and in three days I started feeling dizzy to the point I thought I was going to pass out. When I called the company the person I was given to talk to (who sounded like a teenage girl) wasn't very helpfull. She said to go from one packet a day to half or go every other day. I think if you have a product that can make someone pass out you'd recommend them to stop taking it! They should at least have some warnings about possible side affects. This product may actually help some but I think that some of the testamonials about this product are made up which is a common practice with a multi level marketing company.I agree with another review ""you can get quality probiotics a lot cheaper at the health food store.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

This is a really nice bar for massages. The girls at my local Lush store love to push it as a lotion bar in addition to massages. This is not so. It is too oily for lotion purposes.I do love the scent. It is fresh and light. It soothes and relaxes. I do love the way it makes massages feel. This bar even has fun spots to stick your fingers while using it on your partner. You will need a good shower after the massage unless your skin is super dry. Also one thing to note is a little bit goes a long way. Do not use this bar to massage just use it to spread the oil where needed.,health personal care,health care,massage relaxation
"We used it for less than a month when our baby was just born. It held about 10 infant diapers, I cant imagine how many toddler diapers it would hold, 1? It was disgusting to have to push a dirty poopy diaper into that contraption. And in the end it still smelled. I actually returned mine it was so horrible. I would usually not return something my daughter's poop had touched, but this was such a horrible product I couldn't imagine supporting the company who made it.In the end we switched to cloth. They are amazingly easy to use and clean, way cheeper than disposables and they don't sit in a landfill for 500 YEARS! Thats how long disposables take to degrade. That is disgusting, great legacy for your baby to leave behind... I honestly feel guilty for even using disposables for a few weeks. SWITCH TO CLOTH!!",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

"If I could give this item a half star I would and only because of the characters printed on it and not the tent itself. First of all, the tent is taller than it is wide which creates a physical problem for children who go rip-roaring through the openings- it falls over every time. Secondly, the item twists open but there are still extra poles you must add to it- even then there is no stability. Thirdly, the ""fabric"" reminds me of disposable tablecloth... its papery and could tear easily. There is a picture printed on only two sides of this tent- the only two sides visiable in the advertised picture. No matter what the cost is I would not puchase this item even if it was a dollar. Kids simply cannot play with it. Maybe if you are the creative type who can figure out a way to keep the four end corners grounded it would be worth it- Otherwise, pass by this item and don't look back.",toys games,sports outdoor play,gym sets swings

"I debated for a long time over whether to go with the standard plastic high chair, or splurge for a Svan. Several things tipped me to the side of the Svan.The main thing I like about this chair is that I don't have to throw it away after a year or so. My son can take this chair to college if he wants, as it adjusts in size and I think it can hold up to 175 pounds. I love this adjustability...in fact, we've already lowered the foot rest by an inch to make him more comfortable.I also like the fact that it is quality wood furniture, and that it slides up to the table. I can imagine how nice it will be once my son is older to be able to let him work on art projects and homework at the table in his own chair that is sized for him, and we won't have to get him a booster seat or sit him on phone books!The phthalate-free plastic tray cover is great, as it allows me to give him messy finger food (he's 11 months old now) and it's easy to clean. I also purchased the cushions which I wash every 2-3 weeks.I purchased this chair when my son was 6 months old, and I found that it is not only a great place for him to eat, but it's also a great place for him to sit safely while I'm doing housework or making dinner. He can sit and play with his toys and still be able to see me and feel like he's part of the family.Unlike the first reviewer, I don't have any trouble getting my squirmy little guy into the chair.

"My dogs have been eating this food for several years now, along with the canned.

Everything on this stroller is very sturdy and I am very happy with it. It also turns the best out of the other double front to back strollers out there.

"I am a 24 year old, white female. I have been dying my hair black for the past year. Before that, it was bleached and dyed red for several months (and before that, it was black for a year too!). My natural color is a dirty dishwater ash blonde.I decided to go blonde.. I am working my way towards platinum, more or less.HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:1. The processing lotion is NOT evil. It re-oxidizes the hair dye, and shows you what still needs to be removed. I think this is a crucial step, because your hair will start to re-oxidize and darken in the next few days whether you use it or not.. so better to see what still needs to be done right away!2. Bleaching your hair afterwards will also interact with the Colorfix and darken your hair.3. Expect to use this multiple times if the hair dye is more than a few days old.4. It smells, but it is not as soul-crushing as people say. It smells pretty much the same as a perm. And if you use a leave-in conditioner or damaged hair treatment (which you will probably want to), it pretty much goes away anyways.Overall, this product did what I needed it to do, and it was still cheaper than going pro. To get my shoulder-length hair to a strawberry blonde from a year's worth of black hair dye, I did:-Colorfix, heating occasionally with a blow dryer, left on for an hour-Processing lotion, re-darkened-Colorfix, heating occasionally, left on for 30 minutes-Processing lotion.. not as bad!-Colorfix for 20 minutes-Processing lotion...my turquoise bangs (Special Effects Fish Bowl) were hard to get rid of.That was 3 applications for shoulder-length hair from one box of Colorfix.-Hot placenta/oil treatment and keratin/protein replacement-Got overzealous, tried to bleach it... it re-darkened waaay worse than with the processing lotion!-Second box of Colorfix the next day, after another hot oil treatment; same alternating Colorfix/heat/processing lotion.-The next day, and another oil treatment later.. I bleached it again with a violet based bleach.I am now strawberry blonde, and giving my hair a rest for a week or so. The first two inches of growth are almost platinum, as the hair closer to your head logically hasn't been dyed as many times as the ends.Don't buy this product expecting to magically change your hair color with no problem. BUT DO buy this product if you need a reliable dye remover that does literally what the directions say it will. It damaged my hair a bit, but it was seriously 10% of the damage that bleaching does. This is the best dye remover I have ever used, and it removed the dye evenly every time.. no blotchy, streaky hair.Just be patient, commit to the process, and prepare to use a protein filler on your hair before you do anything afterwards. Your hair will thank you.I would definitely use this again! (But with blonde hair, I totally won't have to. ^_^)",beauty,tools accessories,hair coloring tools

I must start by saying that I paid $50.00 at Linens-n-Things for the castle by price matching and a coupon so I did not pay full price for this toy (a good thing at that). My 3 yr old daughter wanted this soooo very badly for her birthday so of course the little princess got her princess castle. While I was impressed with the beautiful detail of the castle itself I was suprised with the size. The castle itself appears to be a good size but the inside is small and really there is no room to play with the dolls. My daughter has had it for 3 days and really has not played all that much with it.
